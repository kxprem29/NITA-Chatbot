The department
has diverse research dimensions in various Chemical engineering domains which
include fluid dynamics, numerical simulation, catalysis and reaction
engineering, environmental engineering, biofuel, bioenergy, renewable energy,
sustainable engineering, energy and fuel technology, materials engineering,
nanotechnology, and polymer technology, as well as many other emerging and
pressing areas of chemical engineering.
Some of the recent technologies developed in-house for
commercialization are:
·
Natural colorant production
from microalgae for pharmaceutical industry
·
Edible coating of foods from
waste biomass
·
To make specially designed Wind
Deflectors for window panes that allow ventilation and airflow into the house
irrespective of their direction
·
Design of bio-energy integrated
off-grid hybrid power system
·
Alternative processing method
of latex
·
Process for isolation of
nutritional constituents from biomass
·
Method for stabilizing bio-based
infrastructural materials against deterioration
·
Low-cost bio-based fuel for
replacement of fossil fuel
