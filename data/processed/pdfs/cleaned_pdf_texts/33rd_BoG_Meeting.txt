Item No. 33.1: Confirmation of the Minutes of 32nd Board of Governors (BoG) Meeting of NIT Agartala.

The minutes of 32nd Board of Governors, held on January 17, 2015, were circulated among the Members. Shri Sanjeev K. Sharma, Director (NITs), MHRD, suggested incorporating some changes. After detailed discussion, the BoG confirmed the minutes incorporating the changes and with the following observations:

(i) Item No. ‘37.16.’ and '37.16.9’ of 32nd BOG minutes will be read as Item No. ‘32.16.8’ and ‘32.16.9’, respectively.
(ii) ‘Item No. 32.16.8 of 32nd BoG meeting on CAS matter is placed as separate Agenda Item No. 33.2.

Item No. 33.2: Writ Petition No.W.P.(C) 97 of 2013 filed by Dr. Prasun Chakraborti & three others for providing Career Advancement Scheme (CAS) benefit and the Judgment passed by the Hon’ble High Court of Tripura dated January 12, 2015.

A Special Meeting of the BoG was called in view of the directions passed by the Hon’ble High Court of Tripura by Judgement dated 12/1/2015 in WP(C) 97 of 2013 filed by Dr. Prasun Chakraborti and three others. Considering the above directions issued by the Hon’ble High Court, the 32nd meeting of the BoG held on 17/1/2015 recommended that due process be followed for examination of applications of the 4 petitioners through a selection committee as stipulated for CAS. After the said meeting of the BoG, NIT Agartala received an e-mail from the Director (NITs), MHRD, Govt. of India, on March 16, 2015, and letter No.F.39-10/2015-TS.10 dated 16/3/2015 issued by Under Secretary (NITs), MHRD, regarding the CAS with regard to the decision on the Agenda Item No.32.16.8, which inter alia mentioned that no permission shall be granted for conducting selection under CAS in any institute after 30/4/2013 as the institutes have to adopt implementation of 4-tier Cadre structure. It was also mentioned in the letter of MHRD that NIT Agartala may seek an extension of time from the Hon’ble High Court for taking a decision according to the direction issued by the Hon’ble High Court. Accordingly, on the basis of the prayer of NIT, Agartala, vide C.M. Application No.102 of 2015 in WP(C) No.97 of 2013 (DO), the Hon’ble High Court on 31.3.2015 granted time until 15.05.2015 to take a decision on its directions and to communicate the decision of the BoG to the petitioners by 31/05/2015.

It is evident from the above that the decision on Agenda No.32.16.8 taken in the 32nd BoG meeting in response to the directions of the Hon’ble High Court of Tripura is beyond the powers and jurisdiction of the BoG. Hence this decision of the 32nd meeting of BoG is not ratified. Since the decision of the NIT Council to dispense with CAS from April 30, 2013, is final and binding on all NITs, this meeting of BoG resolved that the BoG cannot process any case of CAS at NIT Agartala after April 30, 2013. As CAS cannot be considered, hence the apprehension of petitioners that they may be victimised for promotion is misplaced. This decision may be communicated to Dr. Prasun Chakraborti and three other petitioners of WP (C) No.97 of 2013 (D.O.).
