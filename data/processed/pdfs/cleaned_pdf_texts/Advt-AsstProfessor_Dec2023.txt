10. The Institute has the right to set norms higher than the minimum eligibility criteria and areas of specialization while short listing, taking into accounts the specific requirements of the individual departments. The short listing norms may not be uniform across the departments/ posts of the Institute and shall be binding on all the applicants. The decision of the Institute related to all matters pertaining to the recruitment shall be final and binding on the applicants.

11. Apart from merit, the specialization of a candidate within a department will pay a vital role in selection. Candidates with specialization having greater need by the department will be given preference. Candidates with studentship or work experience in reputed Universities, Institution or Industry or with greater relevance to the academic programs of the department will be given preference.

12. The essential qualifications, requirements, and credit points are the minimum criteria only for deciding the eligibility. This shall not ensure short-listings for further selection processes. The Institute reserves rights to set a higher criterion for short listing. The Institute reserves the right to screen and call only those candidates who are found prima-facie suitable for being considered by the Section Committee. Thus, just mere fulfilling the prescribed conditions would not entitle the candidates to be called for presentation and interview.

Candidates are expected to have good academic records throughout with education from reputed institutions.

13. Departments will make an attempt to set “shortlisting criteria” that can be easily implemented. But, considering the multiple attributes that need to be considered, it may become necessary to make case by case exceptions. Short listing criteria may include, among others, such conditions such as:

(i) Superior academic records — all through first class or higher grades in B. Tech./ M. Tech/ M. Sc/ M.A/ MBA/ M. Com. Higher than the advertised criteria;

(ii) Reputation of the institutions from where the candidate has obtained degrees;

(iii) Number of unsuccessful attempts for the same post;

(iv) Specializations, including micro specialization;

(v) Professional service record — the reputation of the organization where experience has been earned, the nature of the job, current activities, etc.

14. Recruitment to all the posts of faculty positions will be on a direct selection basis only.

15. If required, written tests may be conducted for candidates in the specified department(s) for the post of faculty positions. The date and time may be found in the intimation mail sent to the candidates and also available on the recruitment website i.e., https://www.nita.ac.in. In that case, based on the performance in the Written Test candidates will be shortlisted for the subsequent selection process i.e., Presentation and Interview after documents verification.

The Institute may, however, call the candidates directly for presentation and Interview, without any written test. With regard to the above, the decision of the Institute shall be final and binding.
