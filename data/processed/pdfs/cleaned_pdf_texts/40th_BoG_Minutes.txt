Item No. 40.4: To consider initiation of recruitment process for appointment of
faculty members against vacant permanent posts as per Recruitment
System approved by the Council at its 10th Meeting held on 26-05-2017.
The Senate nominated members of the Board expressed their concern about the status and
hurdles of promotion/ consideration to higher GP that may arise particularly in the case of
regular Assistant Professors with GP 6000 and GP 7000, since as per new Recruitment
Statutes/ Rules (Flexible Faculty Structure), GP 6000 and GP 7000 are for contract
appointment. They also expressed that the existing regular faculty members may be mapped
to new recruitment statutes.

The Board noted the relevant provisions of NITSER Act, existing Statutes, proposed
modification of existing Statutes in Item No 40.3 and felt that some legal issues may arise, if
the Advertisement for recruitment is published now as per new Recruitment Statutes/ Rules
(Flexible Faculty Structure) and accordingly, the Board decided to initiate recruitment
process for all vacant posts of Asst Professor (On Contract in PB3, with GP 6000 & 7000),
Asst. Professor (with GP 8000), Associate Professors (with GP 9500) and Professors (with
GP 10500), subsequently after approval of the Visitor (Hon’ble President of India) for
modification of Statutes, as per requirement of provisions of Section 26 (3) and 26 (4) of
NITSER Act.

Item No. 40.5: To prepare Guidelines for payment of TA/DA to Non-Official
Members of various Committees (including Members of Statutory
Authorities as per NITSER Act and Statutes) Experts/ NITA Guests.
