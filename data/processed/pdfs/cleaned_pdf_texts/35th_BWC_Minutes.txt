11) To confirm the item by the BWC already approved in its 34th meeting held on August 24, 2015 (Item No. 34.23 to 34.31) to be confirmed in the 35th BWC meeting.

The BWC confirmed the decision taken in its 34th meeting against item No. 34.23 to 34.31.

12) Any other Item with the permission of the Chair

i) To consider the estimate for “Yearly repairs of Submersible Pump set 2.0HP/3.0HP/5.0HP at NIT, Agartala Complex for the year 2015-16.” Estimated Cost: Rs. 3,60,117.00

The BWC approved the proposal with a total estimated cost of Rs. 3,60,117.00 to award the work by inviting open tender.

ii) To consider the estimate for “Annual maintenance at all buildings of NIT Agartala including Hostels & Quarters during the year 2016-17”. Estimated Cost: Rs. 49,79,491.00

The BWC accepted the proposal with a total estimated cost of Rs. 49,79,491.00, for placing the same to the FC and BOG for approval.

Item No. 35.3: To consider the award of work “Up-gradation of the internal main road with both side footpath including side drain, electric post, bus stop, sitting arrangement at a certain interval & conduit from main gate-1 to auxiliary gate-2 via housing and boys hostel & auxiliary gate-2 to main gate-1 and auditorium to existing play ground (old) at NIT Agartala” at a cost of Rs. 12,62,33,747.00.

The BWC strongly felt the need for taking up the work and observed the following:

The existing roads are without footpaths (single lane standard) having a 3.75 m average width, and the condition of the roads is not good to cater to the present traffic volume. The roads connecting the NITA administrative building, Auditorium, Workshop, CRF Building, Hospital, all the Boy’s and Girl’s Hostels, Guest House, Director’s Bungalow, Market, Sports Complex, Play Ground, Quarters, etc., need up-gradation. Once the roads are widened from 3.75 m width (existing) to 7.00 m width (double lane standard) with footpath, the traffic volume will be well accommodated in the future.

The BWC also noted that the Estate Section prepared the estimate at a cost of Rs. 866.85 lakhs based on TSR PWD 2011 for civil work and Rs. 62.58 lakh for electrical work (which is based on DSR 2012 (Elect), existing approved rates of NITA, TSECL store issue rate, market rate analysis, and price lists). Thus, the total estimated cost stands for Rs. 929.43 lakh without cost index. Considering a cost index @ 37.5% above on TSR-2011(PWD) for civil work and @ 48% above on DSR-2012 for electrical work, the estimated cost comes to Rs. 12,62,33,747.00.

The BWC approved the estimate and suggested starting the work on priority, based on an open tender process (Three Bid System/Three Envelope System) after administrative approval from

the FC & BOG. The BWC also decided that after the tendering process is completed, approval from the BWC, FC, and BOG shall be obtained before placing the order, as per requirement.

Item No. 35.4: To consider the total quantified variation (including extra items, substitute items, etc., in totality) in the work of Construction of Sports Complex at NIT Agartala at a cost of Rs. 5,34,16,195.00.

On actual requirement and in order to maintain the sequence of the work, variation occurred, and actual quantified variations, including extra items and substitute items, were placed before the 35th BWC meeting in accordance with the suggestion of the BWC in its 34th meeting. The positions of the variations are hereunder.

| S. No. | Nature of work                               | As per Agreement (A) | As per execution (B) | Amount (Rs.) |
| :----- | :-------------------------------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- | :----------- |
| 1.     | Civil Work                                  |                      |                      |              |
| 2.     | Electrical Work                             |                      |                      |              |
| 3.     | Fire Fighting Work                          |                      |                      |              |
|        | **Total**                                   |                      |                      |              |

The total difference is (B-A), which stands for Rs. 5,34,16,194.55 on the higher side, i.e., 9.87% above the agreement amount and within the permitted limit as per the CPWD system.

During discussion, it was noted that some changes were made as per requirement and with the approval of the Competent Authority, which are permitted during the execution of civil works as per the CPWD system. The variations were unavoidable in view of the following reasons:

1.  Topography of land (hilly area) and additional requirement of land

2.  Deviation on BOQ items in RCC and reinforcement due to an increase in the length of the retaining wall and providing a provision of retaining wall with counter fort (as per actual site requirement), noted during the execution of works.

3.  Structural steel quantities are deviated following revisions of dimensions of span in the aquatic centre from 36.00 meters to 42.00 meters to meet the national and international standard, and an alternative option of structural steel and roof steel has been accommodated in lieu of sky flex. In view of minimizing power consumption, UV rays protection in order to minimize the

on February 10, 2016/ NITA

temperature, etc., structural steel roofing with Polycarbonate has been recommended in lieu of Sky Flex.

4.  Electrical work

As per actual site requirement, items on different sizes of underground XLPE ARMOURED LT cables were required to be executed to maintain a reasonable distance from the 200 KVA sub-station to the main LT panel, Feeder pillar, and road light pillar. This is the lion’s share of the variation of electrical items due to the increase in cable length.

5.  Fire Fighting

Due to a change of location of the pump house, as per actual requirement, 100mm dia. and 150mm dia. ERW M.S. pipes are required to be increased in length in the gap between the pump house and other buildings. Further, one additional pump room was added to cover the demands of the entire sports complex area. As such, 3 (three) additional pumps (2 nos. 75HP and 1 no. 15HP) and 1 panel board were required to be installed in addition.

As per the suggestion of the BWC, negotiations were conducted with M/S NCC Limited, and they agreed to reduce the rate in structural steel from Rs. 95.00 to Rs. 94.90 per Kg and polycarbonate from Rs. 4445.00 to Rs. 4422.78 per sq m beyond 30% of the excess work on these items as per BOQ.

Thus, the overall quantified variation comes down to Rs. 5,33,22,626.65 instead of Rs. 5,34,16,194.55.

The BWC accepted the technical reasons for deviations which were not avoidable for such a large-size project related to the Sports Complex and approved the quantified variation statement of Rs. 5,34,16,194.55 for placing the same to the FC and BOG for approval.

Item No. 35.5: “Construction of Central Lecture Hall Complex having 27 Class Rooms at NIT Agartala”.

The BWC decided to defer the proposal due to a paucity of funds, for the time being.

Item No. 35.6: To consider various construction activities already approved by the Chairman, BWC, for ratification by the BWC.

The Building and Works committee ratified all decisions of the Chairman, BWC (all the 13 proposals) under agenda item no. 35.6.

Item No. 35.7: To consider the estimate for “Supply, Installation, Testing and Commissioning of Split type AC with internal wiring at Administrative Block-I under NIT Agartala” at a cost of Rs. 29,49,620.00

The BWC accepted the estimate and suggested initiating further action as per the rules for “Procurement of Goods & Services”.

Item No. 35.12: To consider the proposal for “Providing and fixing of GI exposed pipe instead of PPR pipe at 1500 boy’s hostel at NIT Agartala.

Item No. 35.14: To consider the estimate for “M/tc. of Mechanical Engineering Department / Extension of Smithy Workshop, Casting Shop and Extension of Corridor up to I.C. Engine lab by providing GCI sheet etc. during the year 2015-16” at a cost of Rs. 8,42,544.00

The BWC approved the proposal to award the work by inviting open tender.

Item No. 35.15: To consider the estimate for “Maintenance as well as Construction of D.G. Sheds — 4 (Four) Numbers including approach road of NIT Agartala Campus Area” at a cost of Rs. 7,45,231.00.

Due to the exclusion of one number 6(six)-passenger lift at the Director’s Bungalow of NIT Agartala, the original estimate of Rs. 2,86,51,140.00 for the execution of the work of Supply, Installation, Testing & Commissioning of 15 (Fifteen) Nos. has been revised for the amount of Rs. 2,67,34,665.00 (Rupees Two Crore Sixty Seven Lakh Thirty Four Thousand Six Hundred Sixty Five Only).

The proposal for execution of the work through an open tender method with a revised estimate amounting to Rs. 2,67,34,665.00 was placed before the BWC.

The BWC strongly felt the necessity of installing lifts (which are essentially required to assist PwD students & employees) and accepted the estimate for “open tendering process of procurement” subject to approval by the FC and BOG of NIT, Agartala. The BWC felt that while inviting tenders, the provision of a 3-year AMC after the expiry of the warranty period should be kept, with provision for one repeat order for AMC, if required. While selecting the lowest techno-economical bidder for the award of supply and installation of lifts, the AMC value may also be considered during the evaluation of financial bids.
