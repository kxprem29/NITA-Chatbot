| Agenda No. 42.10: “Design, Supply, Construction, Erection, trial run and commissioning of a water treatment plant of capacity 2.0 MLD and construction of 67 (sixty-seven) Nos. of overhead reservoirs, pipe laying work, construction of pump house including site development and boundary wall, electrical and mechanical components at NIT Agartala” at a cost of Rs. 1458.00 lakh. | The agenda was broadly discussed and opined that at present, water supply is maintained through borewell pumping by submersible pumps. It is noted that the said pumps frequently develop faults, and a smooth supply of water is hampered, involving a lot of maintenance costs. Moreover, the required water demand is also increasing, and, in many cases, installed pumps are insufficient to meet the demand. Besides that, the iron content is more than the permissible limit. To remove the difficulties and considering the present requirement of the institute, the existing scattered borewell pumping system shall be replaced by a “Water distribution system including IRP facilities at NIT Agartala Campus." In this respect, PWD(MWS), Govt. of Tripura, is very much experienced to execute such types of work, and the project may be awarded to PWD(MWS), Govt. of Tripura, which has already been approved in the 43rd BWC against additional agenda No. 43.24.1. |
| Agenda No. 42.11: To consider the estimate for the work of “Renovation of the allotted room for DST Project at NIT Agartala. Rs. 2,78,541.00                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | BWC noted the action taken report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
