After threadbare discussions on the above item, as suggested by the Board of Governors, the SENATE expressed the following views:
*   To uphold the standard and quality of teaching, it is not possible to impart teaching to 184 students with the existing infrastructure, laboratory facilities, and faculty strength.
*   An adequate number of candidates has not been found in spite of several advertisements given in local and national dailies inviting applications for recruitment to the posts of Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, or Professor for the Civil Engineering Department.

*   Presently, the Civil Engineering Department is running with only 29 faculty members, whereas the minimum requirement is 53 faculty members. An institute of eminence cannot afford to dilute the quality of teaching.
*   The members of the SENATE opined that the Institute should not take the risk of enhancing seats to 150. It is better to reduce it to 120 or, in extreme cases, it may go up to 150 if the situation demands.
