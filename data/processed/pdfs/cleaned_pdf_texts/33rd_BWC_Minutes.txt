| 1       | 32.3     | To consider various construction activities already approved by the Director for ratification by the BWC.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | The Building & Works Committee noted the proposal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 3       | 32.5     | To consider the total tentative deviation (including extra items, substitute items, etc., in totality) in the work of "Construction of Administrative Blocks- I & II and Seminar Hall at NIT Agartala" at a cost of Rs. 4,17,77,225.00.                                                                 | With respect to the deviation statement for the work "Construction of Administrative Blocks- I & II and Seminar Hall at NIT Agartala" under Agreement No: 05/NITA/Estate/2010-11, the total executed amount of work was found to be Rs. 42,62,63,712.00 against the agreement amount of Rs. 39,13,01,646.00. This was placed before the BWC in its 32nd Meeting. After review, the BWC recommended that the Estate Section check and verify the rates of extra items and substitute items and place the report before the next BWC.  Also, the BWC recommended including the work proposed in agenda item no. 32.18.5 (i.e., "Cement concrete pavement road and Brick masonry retaining wall in front of Admin Block-1 and Knowledge Park at NIT Agartala") under the existing agreement.  Besides, another work, as stated in agenda item no. 33.5 (i.e., "Bamboo wood flooring and wall cladding including split AC in Director's Chamber and Board Room in Admin Block-1 at NIT Agartala"), is also to be included under the same agreement, as the work has already been executed in the Director's Chamber & Board Meeting Hall in Admin Block-1 for the smooth running of office business.  Thus, the total value of work executed stands at Rs. 46,64,90,974.00, which is 19.20% above the agreement amount. This has been examined and approved by the BWC for early completion of the work, avoiding tender formalities due to the Institute's location's backwardness and the geographical condition of the state of Tripura.  At the outset, the Director informed the committee that it was not possible to take up the work separately after calling for tenders and observing due formalities, considering the time involved in such a process due to the Institute's location's backwardness and the geographical condition of the state of Tripura, which is a landlocked state on the northeastern fringe of India. Furthermore, there is a dearth of capable and resourceful contractors in Tripura to execute such road work by generating great speed in execution with readily available manpower and materials. In view of the above, M/S NCC Limited, a reputed company, has been preferred for executing the work as an extra/additional item of work under their running agreement.  The Building & Works Committee approved the proposal and recommended it to the Finance Committee (FC) and BOG for approval. |
