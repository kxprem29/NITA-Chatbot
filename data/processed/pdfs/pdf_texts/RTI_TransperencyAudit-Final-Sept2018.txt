A FRAMEWORK FOR TRANSPARENCY AUDIT
The RTI Act under section 4 provides a comprehensive framework for promoting openness in the functioning of the public authorities.
While Section 4(1) (a) provides a general guideline for record management, so that the information could be easily stored and retained,
the sub-sections b, c and d of Section 4 relate to the organizational objects and functions. Sub-sections (b), (c) and (d) of Section 4 of the
RTI Act and other related information can be grouped under six categories; namely, 1-organsiation and function, 2- Budget and
programmes, 3- Publicity and public interface, 4-E. governance, 5-Information as prescribed and 6. Information disclosed on own
initiative.
