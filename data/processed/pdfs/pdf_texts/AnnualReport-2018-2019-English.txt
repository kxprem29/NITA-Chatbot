10.0 ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT
10.1 Introduction:
Department of Electrical Engineering is one of the enriched and primogenital
branches of engineering of the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Agartala.
This Department has been fulfilling the need of the state of Tripura as well as the
nation by developing technical manpower in Electrical Engineering field since its
inception in 1965. In this long 53 years of its journey, being a pivotal branch of
the then Tripura Engineering College, this department has witnessed many ups
and downs. Still, it has produced a great number of capable electrical engineers
who in turn spread their talent around various parts of the globe thereby
enhancing the image of the institute in general and branch in particular.
The Electrical Engineering Department started with an annual intake of 20 seats in
1965 and consecutively increased to 40 in 1981. After conversion of the Tripura
Engineering College into National Institute of Technology in 2006, not only the
intake has been increased to 90 but also this conversion has given a golden
opportunity to the department to be flourished in all the probable ways in order to
boost up the teaching learning process.
10.2 Academic Programme:
Electrical Engineering Department has progressed noticeably with annual intake of
90 for 4 years (8 semesters) B.Tech program and annual intake of 64 for 2 years
(4 semesters) M. Tech. programme. Apart from B.Tech. and M. Tech. Electrical
Engineering department started Ph.D programme from 2008 academic session.
The first batch of M.Tech in Electrical Engineering has been started in 2008 with
specialization in Power Electronics & Drives. Considering the aspiration of the
students and keeping in view the present trend of employment opportunity in
Power & Industrial sector and also faculty necessity in academic field, two more
specializations, namely (a) Power System and (b) Instrumentation have also been
introduced in M.Tech curriculum of Electrical Engineering from the academic
session 2010-2011. The first batch of students of both the specializations has
successfully completed their course. Therefore presently the department is
offering M.Tech in the following specializations viz. (a) Power System, (b)
Instrumentation (c) Power Electronics & Drives and (d) Integrated Energy
Systems. Similarly, an excellent response has been obtained for Ph.D programme.
Several candidates from academic arena and industry have shown their interests
for pursuing their Ph.D work in the Department of Electrical Engineering and
enrolled their names in the programme. At present 28 nos. (Part time & Full time)
candidates are carrying out their Ph.D work in the department. It is worth to be
mentioned here that the opportunity of this higher learning has opened up an
avenue for the in-house faculties and staff to obtain higher degrees for their
professional development without any need to go outside the state. Some seats
are reserved for institutional candidates in this regard. The department has
awarded 07 (seven) Ph.D degree in this academic year.

1. Communication Vector Network Analyzer (VNA, Rohde & Schwarz, ZNB
Lab 20) is installed in the communication laboratory. It is a
vital instrument for RF design laboratories as well as
many manufacturing and service areas. The primary use
of a VNA is to determine the S-parameters of passive
components, including cables, filters, switches,
diplexers, duplexers, couplers, bridges, transformers,
power splitters, combiners, circulators, isolators,
attenuators, antennas etc. In addition, VNAs can also
characterize active devices such as transistors and
amplifiers using S-parameters, as long as they are
operating in their linear mode of operation.
2. Microelectronics & Source Measurement Unit (SMU) instrument has been
Nanoelectron consolidated in the Nano and microelectronics laboratory
which has strengthen the device (up to few nano-meter

13.0 DEPARTMENT HUMANITIES & SOCIAL
SCIENCES
13.1 Introduction:
The ultimate objective of any education system is to produce human capital who
will be responsible citizen, besides excelling in his/her own domain. To produce a
complete technocrat, only technical knowledge seldom serves the purpose. He/
She has to be socially aware with a compassionate human faculty. The
Department of Humanities & Social Sciences was established with an objective of
making an engineer enlightened with adequate knowledge of his/ her
surroundings. The approach of the Department has always been interdisciplinary.
The Department of Humanities and Social Sciences has a language communication
skills and multimedia lab which is developed in collaboration with CACM, IIT
Kharagpur. The lab which functions on a carefully designed software ISILS
