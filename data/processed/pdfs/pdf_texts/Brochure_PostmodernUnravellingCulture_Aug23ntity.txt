ABOUT THE CONFERENCE:
Postmodernism has dominated the cultural sphere since the 1960s, and it has
become an embedded umbrella term that pervades the theoretical framework
of contemporary critical analysis. Alan Kirby in an influential essay, 8Death of
Postmodernism and Beyond9 (2006) has proclaimed the shift from
postmodernism to 8Digimodernism9, commensurate with the digital revolution
that characterises 21st century life and culture. The critical theories [viz. post-
postmodernism (Turner), meta-modernism (Vermeulen and van den Akker),
trans-postmodernism (Epstein)] that have proliferated in the last two decades,
to characterize an era in the 8aftermath9 of postmodernism; categorically or
tangentially (albeit, ironically!), fall under the rubric of the postmodern. Even
the critics who ostensibly distance themselves from the tenets of
postmodernism, take it as a point of departure. The gargantuan shadow of
postmodernism undeniably encroaches upon all forms of cultural phenomena
still. It is therefore, imperative to interrogate the predominance as well as the
waning effects and traces of the seemingly ubiquitous interpretive lens of
postmodernism. Is cultural criticism still entangled in the deeply rooted matrix
of postmodern critical methodology? How has the locus of identity
metamorphosed in tandem with the sociocultural transformations? This
international conference would attempt to deliberate the (dis)/continuities of
the postmodern turn to determine the locus of contemporary cultural mores
vis-à-vis the theoretical modes of criticism. We are thus encouraging you to
8unravel9 (in the true sense of the term) the behemoth of postmodernism, so as
to (or not to!) reach towards a critical consensus.
CONFERENCE SUB THEMES:
Posthumanism, Post-theory, Post-feminism, Postcolonialism, Poststructuralism,
Digital Humanities, Trauma Studies, Cultural Memory Studies, Media Studies,
Medical Humanities, Popular Culture, Critical Theory, Film Studies, Cultural
Studies, Ecocriticism, Translation Studies, Queer Studies, Contemporary Politics
The call for papers is however, not confined to the central theme of the
conference but can be approached tangentially as well.
PARTICIPANTS:
Academicians, Researchers, Faculty Members, Research Scholars, Policy Makers,
and PG Students.

ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGEMENT, HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES:
The Department has upgraded into the Department of
Management, Humanities & Social Sciences with effect from the
academic session 2019-2020. The Department of Management,
Humanities & Social Sciences was established with the objective of
making an engineer enlightened with adequate knowledge of
his/her surroundings. The approach of the Department is
interdisciplinary. The Department offers undergraduate courses to
B.Tech students in Economics, Costing, Management Principles,
Management, Business Communication, and Communicative Skill
Development and full-time graduate program in Management.
Besides that, it encourages the students to actively take up
research in various fields of Humanities, Social Sciences and
Management. The Ph.D. program of the Department in Economics,
Literature, and Management has been introduced to serve that very
purpose. Along with these diverse academic departments, the
Department is home to a wide variety of interdisciplinary
collaborations, path-breaking research projects, and unique areas
of study. The ultimate objective of any education system is to
produce human capital who will be responsible citizens, besides
excelling in his/her own domain. To produce a complete
technocrat, only technical knowledge seldom serves the purpose.
He/She has to be socially aware with a compassionate human
faculty.
