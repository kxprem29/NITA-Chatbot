Preface
Civil Engineering Department of NIT Agartala, awards the degree of Master of Technology (M. Tech)
in seven different specializations viz, Environmental Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering, Hydro-
Informatics Engineering, Structural Engineering, Seismic Science and Engineering, Transportation
Engineering and Water Resources Engineering.
The course structures of all post graduate degree programmes are carrying a total of 80 credits and
2000 marks. Semester wise distribution of course and credits are as follows: First semester: 25 credits
and 800 marks for five theory subjects (comprises core, basic core and elective subjects), two labora-
tory subjects and seminar; Second semester: 25 credits and 800 marks for four theory subject (com-
prises core, basic core and elective subjects), two laboratory subjects, comprehensive viva-voce and
project preliminaries; Third semester: 10 credits and 100 marks; and Fourth semester: 20 credits and
300 marks. Third and fourth semester of PG courses will be fully devoted for project works. Minimum
number of class hours for each theory course should be 40 hours.
There will be continuous assessment of the performance of students throughout the semester. Each
theory subject in a semester is evaluated for 100 marks, with the following weightages. Sub-
component weightage: Continuous evaluation: 30 Marks (Attendance: 5 Marks, Quiz: 5 Marks, Class
test: 10 Marks, Assignment: 10 Marks); Mid-semester Examination: 20 Marks; and End-semester Ex-
amination: 50 Marks
The course curriculum of all Post- graduate programmes are designed considering the following six
Programme outcomes (Pos) as formulated by National Board of Accreditation (NBA) and two Pro-
gramme specific outcomes (PSOs)
PO1: An ability to independently carry out research /investigation and development work to solve
practical problems.
PO2: Ability to write and present a substantial technical report/document.
PO3: Students should be able to demonstrate a degree of mastery over the area as per the specializa-
tion of the program. The mastery should be at a level higher than the requirements in the appropriate
bachelor program.
PO4: An ability to identify, formulate and solve Structural system related problems using advanced
level computing techniques.
PO5: An ability to understand the impact of Structural Engineering solutions in a global, economic,
environmental and societal context.
PO6: Able to demonstrate knowledge understanding of the engineering and management principles
and apply these to multidisciplinary environments.
PSO1: An ability to get exposed to advanced courses in Analysis, and Design of RC, PSC, Steel and
composite structures as per the latest design codes and considering current national and international
scenario on Structural Engineering.
PSO2: Students should be industry ready / ready to pursue advanced research by getting hands on
training on latest equipment / software.

Expert opinions are being taken in regular basis in order to improve the quality of teaching learning
process and to attain the programme outcomes efficiently.
In the Final year of M. Tech. programmes (Third and Fourth Semesters) students may also opt for in-
dustrial research. If any student desire to pursue his/her research in reputed industries, he/she may be
allowed to do so, provided:
a. The selected industry is a permanent member of NASSCOM, FICCI and other such industry bod-
ies.
a. The selected industry is approved by the DPPC of the concerned Department.
b. The student selects one supervisor from industry and another supervisor from the Institute.
If any student opts for such industrial research he/she will not receive any scholarship from
the institute in this tenure, even if he/she wants to return back. In such cases the student will
be allowed to complete his/her project in the institute but without any scholarship.
