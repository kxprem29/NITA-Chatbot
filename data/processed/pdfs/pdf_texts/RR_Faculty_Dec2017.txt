ANNEXURE - IV

GUIDELINES / PROCEDURES TO BE FOLLOWED FOR FACULTY

SELECTION IN NITS AND IIEST

Consequent upon approval of the Council of the National Institutes of
Technology, Science Education and Research (NITSER), the Ministry of Human
Resource Development has issued the new Recruitment Rules for faculty on 2g!"
May, 2017 and the same have also been notified in the Gazette on 24" July,
2017 (in respect of NITs & NEST, Shibpur) and an August, 2017 (in respect of
NIT, Andhra Pradesh).

2. As far as the guidelines / procedure to be adopted for selection of faculty
as per the new Recruitment Rules approved by the Council, the following is
hereby informed that:-

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

The qualifications and other terms & conditions of appointment as.
notified in the Gazette are bare minimum and the Board of
Governors can however fix higher benchmarks, higher than the
prescribed in consultation with the Council of NITSER.

All the faculty posts in the Institute shall be filled by direct
recruitment only. The procedure for selection of faculty is given in
Appendix — A1.

Fresh appointment beyond the age of 60 years is discouraged
except in the case of faculty with exceptionally brilliant research
career and with ongoing or approved externally funded research
projects.

There shall be no distinction between external and internal

 

 

 

 

 

(e)

(f)

Wwe \

experience.
All recruitment and pay-fixation shall be done by the BoGs of the
Institutes only on the recommendations of duly constituted

“Selection Committees. There shall be no scope of fixing of altering ~~
pay (pay in pay-band or grade pay) outside the Selection

Committee. The Selection Committee shall be the only entity
empowered to consider the past services and qualifications of a

-candidate.......

While there is no rigid formula for distribution of sanctioned posts
among the Departments and centres within an Institute, Appendix
~— _A2 attached with this communication gives a recipe for
distributing sanctioned faculty posts among various Departments of
an Institute. But the BOG, on the recommendation of the Director,
shall dynamically allocate sanctioned faculty positions among the
Departments taking into consideration academic programmes of
various Departments, existing quality of faculty, expected
retirements and availability of bright candidates.

--- Page 12 ---
(g) | There shall. be necessary provision for inducting faculty from
__ industry (or comparable organizations) with substantial professional
-and R&D experience, but not having a Ph.D. degree. If in the
opinion of the Selection Committee, candidates have good number
(say 10) of publications in leading journals of the field, the

requirement of Ph.D. degree may be waived.
(h) Most leading universities of the world, including the best Institutes
of India have an explicit or implicit policy of not inducting their own
students into the faculty. To avoid such in-breeding, the NITs &

IEST will follow the following policies:

(i) Candidates who have obtained or are expected to obtain
their most recent degree (Ph.D.) from the Institute will normally not
be considered for recruitment, except where there is a 3 years’ gap
(approximately) between leaving the Institute and the expected
date of joining.
(ii) This is not applicable to candidates who are already
members of the faculty, either regular or on contract, and are
pursuing a higher degree in the Institute.
(iii) In special cases, where the Department (at the time of short-
listing) or the Selection Committee feels that an exception needs to
be made (for reasons such as severe shortage of faculty in a given
academic field or exceptionally brilliant candidate or any other), the
reasons for such exceptions are to be recorded in writing and put
up to the Board of Governors for approval. The Board, if convinced,
may confirm the selection. Such appointments will not serve as
precedence. .

(j) As decided by the Council of the Nationa! Institutes of Technology,
Science Education and Research (NITSER), the Institute shall
strive to recruit 50% faculty not domicile of that State in which the
__Institute is located.

APPENDIX - A1

- PROCEDURE FOR SELECTION OF FACULTY IN NIT SYSTEM ~

The procedure outlined here has generally, but not exactly, been followed in —
most of the IITs. The procedure is prescribed as a guideline, without insisting that
it be followed religiously. Boards of Governors may opt for alternative procedures
after examining their merit vis-a-vis the base line procedure given below.

 

 

 

 

 

 

1. The Director will create an “Advisory Committee on Faculty Recruitment

(ACoFAR)” with a senior member of the faculty as the Chairman.

_ Normally, he should be the Dean (Faculty Welfare); but Director shall have
the discretion to assign the responsibility to Dy. Director or another senior

Professor or handle it himself. The Chairman of ACoFAR shall be

authorized to communicate with Departments, candidates and experts on

the advice of Director. In addition, the Committee shall discharge the
following functions:

a) Examine and advise on distribution of faculty positions among
various Departments; .

b) Proactively search for faculty candidates in India and abroad.

c) Assist the Director in examining, short listing criteria and preparing
panels.of short listed candidates submitted by Departments;

d) Examine and recommend proposals for deviation in age, formal
qualifications, industry experience or any other criterion or
guideline; ,

e) Reservation of positions for specialization or sub-specialisation and
rank of faculty to be inducted; and

f Preactively-search_for candidates-fromreserved-categories—and-if
not_available—after repeaied—atiempts,_prepare—proposals- for-de=
reservation in accordance with the relevant rules & regulations.

2... ... The Institute will create_a_panel_of-experts and update it-on annual basis. -.

_The list will be prepared by taking:inputs from Departments. Director may

also add extra names or delete some from the list. Normally, the experts
should be drawn from NITs, IITs, JIMs, IISERs, IISc, HEST, University
Departments, major R&D Laboratories (CSIR, ICAR, DAE, ISRO, DRDO

~etc) and major industry. The list, along with postal and electronic

addresses, designations, specialization and other relevant particulars of
proposed experts is to be placed before the Senate and then the BoG for
their approval. Every higher authority shall have the power to add and
delete names. In addition, fellows of INAE and the 3 Science academies
will be automatically included in the panel. Every attempt should be made
to ensure that major specializations of each Department are adequately
represented in the panel.

Page 12 of 18
IMHRDIRAVNDARR, Pay Anomaly & CAS\Modified Procedure & Guidelines docx]


--- Page 14 ---
 

While the above is a permanent list, upgraded periodically, preferably
every year, the BOG, at its discretion, may permit Director to choose

-experts for-every. single selection process from the full panel or from

specific sub panels.

As per NITSER Act, 2007, the visitor shall nominate one member to the
Selection Committee. It is observed in practice that being present in all

sessions of a selection process (that spreads over two to four weeks)

becomes hard on the distinguished professors who serve as Visitor's
nominees, and they are often unwilling to spare the time. The Ministry will
recommend to the Hon'ble Visitor to nominate a panel of distinguished
persons in different subject areas to serve as Visitor's nominees and
permit institutes to invite them as per their availability and convenience.

The Director will send a copy of the panels approved by the Secretariat of
the Council of NITSER for records.

It is extremely important that the suggested panel of experts is examined

Critically by the Board and the Ministry and any member with a

questionable integrity is removed.

Prior to a selection process, the Director will choose experts from the
approved panels ensuring a reasonable distribution among
specializations, and to the extent possible, diversity of background, place
of work etc.

In addition to the expert members of the Selection Committee, the
Director, as Chairman of the Committee, may invite observers from SC/ST

 

 

and—minoritycommunities—or—any—other—person—of_tepute—to—instill

 

 

—_ confidence imthe-rminds-ofthe- “candidates and-of the Institute-community.

ye

On advice of the Director, the Chairman, ACoFAR will seek from the

_ Departments the _specific_specializations. where .new.faculty.-is tobe.

recruited. The HoDs will consult senior faculty colleagues and prepare the
proposals to the Institute, which will be collated by the Chairman, ACoFAR
and placed before the Director for approval. The Director is expected to
review | the proposals — ornteal and finalize the draft advertisement

other details.

Serving regular faculty members shall be eligible to apply for higher
positions in their own Departments irrespective of their specializations, if
they satisfy other advertised criteria.

Application may be received on paper, on-line or both, depending on the
technological resources of the respective Institute. In addition, the Institute

IMHRDIRAVIDARR, Pay Anomaly & CAS\Modified Procedure & Guidelines.docx]


--- Page 15 ---
12.

13.

14.

15.

will consider applications received against standing advertisement, if any,
and unsolicited applications.

While applications received within the advertised closing date shall
definitely be considered, late applications (upto the interview time) may be
considered at the discretion and convenience of the administration.

In addition to the advertisements, all sections of the institute administration
- Director, members of ACoFAR, HoDs and all faculty members will make
proactive effort to attract applications from prospective candidates, without
making any commitment of selection. Such efforts will include postal and
email correspondence, telephonic talks and public announcement when
there is an opportunity.

Applications, when received, will be organized, relevant information
summarized, and sent to the Departments by the Registry, for short listing.
The objectives of short listing are two folds:-

(a) to reject applications that do not meet advertised criteria and

(b) to select the best candidates from the remaining list so that the
member of candidates to be called for interview with the experts
remains within manageable limits.

Departments will make attempt to set “short listing criteria” that can be
easily implemented. But, considering the multiple attributes that need to
be considered, it may become necessary to make case by case
exceptions. In all such cases the general short listing criteria and the
reasons for exception, if any, are to be recorded in writing. Short listing

 

 

Criteria may-include,among_others,such-conditions as:

 

 

 

 

16.

(i) superior academic record — all through first class career or higher
grades in B.Tech/M.Sc/M.Tech, higher than advertised criteria,

_ (il) reputation of. institutions. from where the candidate has obtained his .... _......

degrees,

(iii) | number of unsuccessful attempts for the same post [Candidates
-who have been rejected in the past may be called only if there is a
good reason, the reason to be recorded in writing. ]

(iv) > specialisation, including micro specialisation, ~

(v) professional service record - reputation of organization where
experience has been earned, nature of job, current activities etc.

The Departments’ recommendations shall be placed before the Director
for the final short-listing. The final list of candidates to meet the Selection
Committee will be arrived at in a combined meeting of the Director, the
ACoFAR, the HoD and at least three senior faculty members of the

the Registrar for personai interview with the selections committee
constituted in accordance with the NITSER Act, 2007 and the Statutes of
the respective Institutes. In addition, the individual institutes may seek
seminar presentation in the Departments, and/or any other form of
academic interaction with the faculty. All such interaction will be open to
the faculty and students of the institute and will be well publicized in
advance to invite a decent audience. The feedback of the faculty will be

located outside the country or otherwise not in a position of attending
personal interview, may be interviewed over video conferencing or be
selected in absentia at the discretion of the Selection Committee.

APPENDIX — A2

=... DISTRIBUTION OF FACULTY POSTS AMONG DEPARTMENTS

 

Every institute shall have only a finite member of faculty posts sanctioned by the
ministry. The distribution of these positions among the Departments will be
flexible to dynamically maximize the number of faculty in position at any given

- time. dt should be appreciated that institutes will be losers and the cause of
education will be hampered if faculty positions which could be filled up in other
Departments are kept vacant simply because current market scenario is making
faculty unavailable in a specific Department. Instead of keeping vacant positions,
if additional faculty are inducted in other Departments, they will contribute to (a)
elective courses in teaching, particularly those electives that are subscribed to by
students across many Departments, (b) research, (c) continuing education, (e)
institute, hostel and SAC management etc. A vacant faculty post serves no one.
At the same time, it is the responsibility of the Director, and of the Board, to
ensure that no Department starves of faculty when candidates are available and
posts are used up elsewhere.

The following table may be taken as a guide for computing “normal faculty
strength” in any Department.

 

 

 

 

 

B Tech Programme (Annual Intake < 50) =X
B Tech Programme (Annual Intake > 50) =15x
Dual degree with existing M. Tech. specialization =0.1x
Dual degree with exclusive M. Tech. specialization =0.2 x
___ Additional B Téch-Programme (Each programme) =0.5-X
. M Tech programme (Each programme) =0.5x
M.Sc. (2 years) programme =0.5x
“M.Sc (5 years) programme =X
MBA Programme (Annual Intake <50) =X .
MBA programme (Annual Intake 750) =1.5x
~ MCA ( (3 Years) Programme oe - = x |
Common theory courses for 1° & 2"° years (per subject) =0.2x
Common practical courses for 1*' & 2™ years (per course) =0.1x
Total = nx »

x = [Sanctioned faculty strength] +n

The normal strength of every Department shall be computed based on the above
scheme, additional factors taken into consideration, rounded and approved: by
the Institute Senate to serve as a guideline for all future recruitment. In case of
serious disagreement among members the Senate, the decision of the BOG shall
be binding.

The above prescription is based on a principle of equal sharing of teaching
responsibility among all faculty members irrespective of rank. In contrast with the
prescription of AICTE, professors of NIT are expected to take up a larger share
of the teaching job, particularly in large classes and in common fundamental
subjects. This principle has the merit of providing better education in basic
subjects, it frees younger faculty to pursue research, particularly those who are
enrolled in Ph.D programmes. Experienced faculty are also expected to spend
less time in preparing for classes and spend the rest of the time in institute
management.

Additional factors shall include, but will not be limited to, expected student
strengths in common courses, open electives, being normally offered by the
Department, common subjects among M Tech specializations, strength of M
Tech courses etc. In general, Departments and centers can be classified into two
.or three groups depending on the above formula and faculty strength calculated
for each group.
