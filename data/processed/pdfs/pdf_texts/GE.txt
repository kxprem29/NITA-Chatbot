PREFACE
Civil Engineering Department of NIT Agartala, awards the degree of Master of Technology (M. Tech) in seven
different specializations viz, Environmental Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering, Hydro-Informatics
Engineering, Structural Engineering, Seismic Science and Engineering, Transportation Engineering and Water
Resources Engineering.
The course structures of all post graduate degree programmes are carrying a total of 80 credits and 2000 marks.
Semester wise distribution of course and credits are as follows: First semester: 25 credits and 800 marks for five
theory subjects (comprises basic core, core and elective subjects), two laboratory subjects and seminar; Second
semester: 25 credits and 800 marks for four theory subject (comprises basic core, core and elective subjects), two
laboratory subjects, comprehensive viva-voce and project preliminaries; Third semester: 10 credits and 100
marks; and Fourth semester: 20 credits and 300 marks. Third and fourth semester of PG courses will be fully
devoted to project works. Minimum requirement of number of class hours for each theory course is 40 hours per
semester.
There will be continuous assessment of the performance of students throughout the semester. Each theory
subject in a semester is evaluated for 100 marks, with the following weightages. Sub-component

to attain the programme outcomes efficiently.
In the Final year of M.Tech programmes (Third and Fourth Semesters) students may also opt for industrial
research. If any student desire to pursue his/her research in reputed industries, he/she may be allowed to do so,
provided:
a. The selected industry is a permanent member of NASSCOM, FICCI and other such industry bodies.
b. The selected industry needs is approved by the DPPC of the concerned Department.
c. The student selects one supervisor from industry and another supervisor from the Institute.
d. If any student opts for such industrial research he/she will not receive any scholarship from the institute
in this tenure, even if he/she wants to return back. In such cases the student will be allowed to complete
his/her project in the institute but without any scholarship.
