HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES.
<New Delhi: Electric vehicles (EVs) may be the buzzword in the automobile industry, but strong hybrid cars
— powered by a petrol or a diesel engine and an electric motor — are also attracting buyers, as seen by the
rise in sales.=
A worldwide problem today is environmental pollution, resulting in the greenhouse effect, therefore the
appearance of eco-friendly cars is a great benefit to the environment. Technology has needed to evolve
greatly to be able to power these automobiles over long distances and the process has not ended yet.
In this run for evolution and efficiency, there are a lot of questions that still remain open and one of them is
what happens at the end of the lifecycle of a battery and an electric motor. As the number of sold electric
5

--- Page 7 ---

cars will increase, the number of electric motors and battery waste will increase too thus leading to a greater
impact on the environment. So, Hybrid Electric Vehicle is a great idea to decrease the usage and disposal of
batteries in the vehicle.
Any vehicle with two sources of power can be called a hybrid vehicle. Hybrid cars get their power from two
sources, a gasoline engine and an electric motor. Hybrid cars are designed that in some cases both power
sources are used simultaneously and in others the sources are used alternatively.
For example, when a hybrid car runs at speeds below 5-10 km/h, e.g., when approaching or leaving a traffic
junction, it runs only on the electric motor, which reduces the fuel consumption.
<Consumers are seeing hybrids as a better option. The sales of strong hybrid and electric vehicles are almost
similar& and this is when there are only 3-4 strong hybrid models in the market today. As more models
come in, the consumption will also go up,= Shashank Srivastava, senior executive director (marketing and
sales), Maruti Suzuki,
Maruti Suzuki, which is the biggest car maker in the country, currently offers the Grand Vitara in a strong
hybrid variant.
India currently has three automobile manufacturers — Maruti Suzuki, Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) and
Honda Cars India — that have launched cars in the hybrid category and are expected to launch more models.
Car buyers like hybrids because they can save on gas and cut their carbon footprint without having to deal
with range anxiety or the need to charge at home.
CONCLUSION:
Concerns about the environment and rising costs of fossil fuels are driving automakers to design and
build cleaner, more energy efficient vehicles, represented especially by hybrid and electric vehicles. This
reduces the CO₂ emissions and other harmful emissions thus having a lower impact on the environment. The
main drawback is the energy source: the batteries. Rare earth elements are available in limited quantities
and expensive, therefore researchers are developing solutions for extracting as much as possible from
discarded batteries. Unfortunately, none of the proposed solutions is used at an extensive level. Based on
their potential, though, the time until they reach industry scale is not far away.

Small Great Ideas!
Human minds are one of the simplest nature-made subject to observe and in
the same time, complex to understand. Experiences and thinking process
makes it so unique. Reaction and stimuli are two terms associated with
experience&.it is like learning from past. As simple as first time we learn to
walk (balanced ourselves against earth’s pulling force) or realized that ice
melts into water and it makes clothes wet and simply enough we walked or
carried umbrella. Ideas that evolve and grow big were just stupid and simple
observations&. call it gravity, call it discovery of fire in the stone age, or a wheel rolling down a slope. The
capability to think and synthesis thoughts to produce ideas and to express them separate us from other
species. Ideas&. a thriving power, an unpopular artform, a trade material. In a world of infinite subjects and
materials to work with and to access infinite ideas to scroll through our human mind often denies to think
something new, discover something wild or experiment. That’s where we start questioning our value and
purpose of our existence. A day when everything would be AI dependent IDEAS would be the only tool to
distinguish us from robots. It needs a mind to think and a courageous heart to express. Dearest thinkers of
the new world, there they wait for your ideas.

CARBON TAXATION ANS IT’S IMPACT ON ECONOMIC SECTOR
The post world war is regarded as the Golden period of Economic development due to its rise in prosperity,
economic value etc while it is true that USA and North America were the major benefiters in this era it is no
secret that the rest of the nation had received their fair share of financial growth. The main source of income
was due to oil and automobile production. Maybe that’s why the interval from 1901 to 1973 was also coined
as the Age of machinery, at least that’s what it was until the oil crisis in 1973. The mass production of newly
booming automobiles, functioned with the help of fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil. These fuels which
were priorly used for domestic and household purposes had found their way to global market. They became
a medium between the nations to mutually trade the resources and form a pact. While this nexus between
resources and technology evidently powered up financial sector. Is that the only thing this amazing
technology offered? What came next was the catastrophe that no one had imagined. It was just the calm
before the storm.
These fossil fuels give carbon dioxide gas on burning, imprudent usage of these non-renewable resources
hiked up the concentration of Co2 and other greenhouse gases in atmosphere leading to deleterious after
effects such as warming up of earth, depletion of ozone layer etc. You might ponder that the only blowback
is the noxious impact on biological living beings and eco-system. Well, you know what? There is more to
beneath the walls of nature destruction.
Have you heard of the Oil Crisis in 1973? The 1973 oil crisis was a major energy shortage triggered by the
Arab members of OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) imposing an oil embargo on
Western countries, including the United States in response to their support for Israel during the Yom Kippur
War. This led to a sharp increase in oil prices, long lines at gas stations etc going down in history as the
biggest economic shock. The deeper we dive into this, the more we realise that the bottom line of all this
issue concerns with the very fact that we are heavily dependent on other nations.
To be a self-sufficient nation is almost impractical in current day’s scenario but to be minimize dependency
on others is one factor to become an empowered nation. Since fossil fuels are not evenly distributed its
only obvious that one nation would have upper hand the over other as an exporter, while it is true that this
exchange in commodities may pave path for under developed or developing nation to build connections
across the world. We must not forget that a sudden cut in supply can affect the whole chain.
To cope up with this we have come up with the idea of renewable energy sources such as sunlight, wind,
geothermal, hydropower energy etc. which are continuously replenished and create far low emissions.
Additionally implementing geological survey throughout the country’s landmass and allocating technologies
19

--- Page 21 ---
20
based on potential renewable resources available addresses the key concern of climate crisis and self-
sustainability.
Then what is the first step to achieve a self-sufficiency?
It is to eliminate all the primary and auxiliary industries related to fossil fuels and power generation to
ensure that no fossil fuel is used.
The Carbon Taxation Policy now enters the picture.
A carbon tax is a policy that would set a fixed price per ton of carbon or carbon dioxide emitted, with a goal
of incentivizing lower carbon emissions.
The tax to be paid is directly proportional to the carbon content in the goods, making both consumers and
firm liable for less carbon emissions. Mainly based on polluter will pay principle this could be a better
approach to search for more efficient and pollution less routes.
Successful Implementation of the policy: Here are some of the successful examples of the policy.
UK – coal use fell sharply after introduction of a carbon tax of around $25 per ton in 2013. In the UK
greenhouse gas emissions have fallen to lowest level since 1890
British Colombia (a province of Canada) introduced a scheme in 2008 to charge a levy on carbon from 2008
and 2012 the fossil fuel consumption decreased by more than 17%.
This seems like a perfect solution for both climate crisis and economy, right?
But, like every coin has two sides, even carbo taxation has both positive and negative effects. Let’s explore
these dual impacts in more detail:
How Carbon Taxation creates positive impact on Corporate Sector:
• Consumer and Investor Expectations: Companies that proactively reduce their carbon footprint
may be seen as more morally responsible in society.
• Global Competition: The impact of carbon taxation can vary among businesses within the same
industry. Companies that are more efficient and less carbon-intensive may gain a competitive
advantage
• Government Incentives: Governments may provide incentives and subsidies for companies that
invest in clean technologies or adopt more sustainable practices.
Negative Role of Carbon Taxation in Economy
• Reducing Efficacy: The administration process of these taxes is quite expensive making it only viable
to only developed countries and few areas of developing countries and reducing its efficacy.
• Resource Re-allocation: While the motto for firms was to come up with a better solution, it has
been seen that the Production may shift to countries with no or lower carbon taxes giving
20

--- Page 22 ---
21
developing countries an incentive to encourage production processes causing pollution i.e.,
Outsourcing of pollution.
• Possibility of tax evasion: Higher taxes may encourage firms to hide carbon emissions prevailing to
corrupted society.
• Hindering Development: A global carbon tax may curtail economic activity in the poor developing
world because they can’t afford the small increase in energy costs.
• Job Displacement: In industries heavily reliant on carbon-intensive processes, efforts to reduce
emissions may lead to job displacement, as certain jobs become obsolete due to the transition to
cleaner technologies.
If we consider the overall economic model, we find out that in various instances this taxation gives
simultaneous gains and losses such as introducing carbon taxation includes cut in other taxes such
as corporate income taxes, personal income taxes and labour income increasing the incentive to
save and invest, thus promoting capital accumulation and human capital. In either case, the result is
an increase in the productive capacity of the economy. However, shifting the taxes onto carbon
reduces the overall efficiency of the tax system a bit (ignoring environmental benefits) and thus
slightly reduces the economic activity.
From a pure revenue-based point of view carbon taxes are broader in respect to taxpayers
opposite to the traditional taxes.
Let us break this down.
Carbon taxation is easier to avoid by shifting to cleaner fuels, driving less etc. serving the purpose of
climate crisis but failing to raise the revenue. On calculating both the pro and con’s it is observed
that the net reduction in GDP is tiny. Moreover, the revenue from the carbon tax can be used to
promote economic activity and mitigate future economic damages from climate change.
Conclusion: Carbon taxation is a practical and effective policy tool that can address environmental
challenges and promote economic welfare. However, its implementation requires thorough
consideration of circumstances and goals of each country. By designing and executing properly, it
can play a pivotal role in the transition to a sustainable and low-carbon economy.

Like The Changing Winds
Every evening, the boy would come to see me.
The god of biscuits and the bringer of sunshine and warmth,
He’d spend the next 10 minutes with me and then disappear past the brown
bungalows only to return the next day.
That was 2 summers ago, the boy now a man, no longer the carrier of sunshine but
the reminder of a dear friend lost to the whims of time.
Like the clouds that abandon the desert, I still see him past the bungalows, but there
is no warmth anymore, my sunshine has turned into a lonely, forgotten winter.
