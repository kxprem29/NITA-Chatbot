4.6 Examination & Evaluation:

Evaluation of the performance of the students is regarded as the most important academic
activity in any educational institution. In NIT Agartala evaluation of the students is made by both
written examination and viva-voce test.

Apart from this the performance of the students is also evaluated through internal assessment.
In every semester Mid-Term and End-Term examinations are conducted, This apart, class tests
and viva-voce test for all subjects are also taken.

Marks are awarded to the students in each subject and on the basis of that Semester
Performance Index (SPI) is calculated. Taking the result of both Mid-Term and End-Term
Examination Cumulative Performance Index (CPI/CGPA) is calculated.

In brief the performance of a student is evaluated through written examination, class test, viva-
voce test, practical examination, attendance and above all the behavior of the students.

5.6 Institute -Industry Collaboration:

1. Dr. Tarunkanti Bandyopadhyay , HOD, Bio Engineering is taking initiative as a active leader
to collaborate with Dr. Saswata Goswami, Scientist -E, Center of Innovative and Applied
Bioprocessing (CIAB), Mohali 160071, Punjab and CIAB, Mohali has selected to Dr.
Tarunkanti Bandyopadhyay as a expert for the project proposal with Thaper Industries (DBT
funded project on Nano Cellulose), Thaper University.

2. Dr. Tarunkanti Bandyopadhyay, HOD, Bio Engineering, has also started to collaborate with
Dr. S.S.Maitra, Associate professor in Biochemical Engineering, School of
Biotechnology, J.N.U. One multi institute joint project proposal on microbiologically enhanced
fracking of oil bearing shales will be submitted with JNU. India has lot of oil bearing shales
but no technology to recover oil from it. We can study how hydrodynamics of fracking get
changed by addition of bacterial polymers in fracking water or whether injecting methanogen
and producing methane in situ in shale stones improves fracturing.

3. One multi institute project proposal has been submitted with NIT, Durgapur to DBT for large
scale xylanase production through recombinant Strain where Dr. Tarunkanti Bandyopadhyay,
HOD is a coordinator.

4. Department is taking initiative for industrial collaboration with different industries to create a
bridge between industry and institute. In this regard, Dr. Biswanath Bhunia along with Dr.
Tarunkanti Bandyopadhyay, HOD are looking for an industrial project proposal which will be
submitted shortly collaboration with Rossari Biotech and CIAB Mohali.

5.7 Industrial Consultancy and Sponsored Research :

There is no industrial consultancy in the department. However, one sponsored project is going
on in the department. In near future it is required to start industrial consultancy.

Annual Report 2014-15

10.0 ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT
10.1 Introduction:

Department of Electrical Engineering is one of the enriched and primogenital branches of
engineering of the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Agartala (formerly Tripura Engineering
College, Govt. of Tripura). This Department has been fulfilling the need of the state Tripura as
well as the nation by developing technical manpower in Electrical Engineering field since its
inception in 1965. In this long 45 years of its journey, being a pivotal branch of the Tripura
Engineering College, this department has witnessed many ups and downs. Still, it has produced
a great number of capable electrical engineers who in turn spread their talent around various
parts of the globe thereby enhancing the image of the institute in general and branch in
particular.

The Electrical Engineering Department started with an annual intake of 20 seats in 1965 and
consecutively increased to 40 in 1981. After conversion of the Tripura Engineering College into
National Institute of Technology (NIT) in 2006, not only the intake has been increased to 90 but
also this conversion has given a golden opportunity to the department to be flourished in all the
probable ways in order to boost up the teaching learning process.

10.2 Academic Programme:

Electrical Engineering Department has progressed noticeably with annual intake of 90 for 4
years (8 semesters) B.Tech program and annual intake of 54 for 2 years (4 semesters) M. Tech.
programme. Apart from B.Tech. and M. Tech. Electrical Engineering department started Ph.D
program from 2008 academic session. The first batch of M.Tech in Electrical Engineering has
been started in 2008 with specialization in Power Electronics & Drives, Considering the
aspiration of the students and keeping in view the present trend of employment opportunity in
Power & Industrial sector and also faculty necessity in academic field, two more specializations,
namely (a) Power System and (b) Instrumentation have also been introduced in M.Tech
curriculum of Electrical Engineering from the academic session 2010-2011. The first batch of
students of both the specializations has successfully completed their course. Therefore
presently the department is offering M.Tech in following specialization viz. (a) Power System,
(b) Instrumentation and (c) Power Electronics & Drives. Similarly, an excellent response has
been obtained for Ph.D program. Several candidates from academic arena and industry have
shown their interests for pursuing their Ph.D work in the Department of Electrical Engineering
and enrolled their names in the program. At present 30 nos. of candidates are carrying out their
Ph. D work in the department. It is worth to be mentioned here that the opportunity of this higher
learning has opened up an avenue for the in-house faculties and staff to obtain higher degrees
for their professional development without any need to go outside the state. Some seats are
reserved for institutional candidates in this regard.

Academic Program Goals:
The Electrical Engineering Department has goals for undergraduate, graduate as well as Ph.D
programs.

The undergraduate program goal is to develop specialized proficiencies in the concepts,

methods, and tools required for entry level positions in Electrical Engineering (EE) and for
graduate and professional studies.

13.0 HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES DEPARTMENT
13.1 Introduction:

The ultimate objective of any education system is to produce human capital who will be
responsible citizen, besides excelling in his/her own domain. To produce a complete technocrat,
only technical knowledge seldom serves the purpose. He/ She has to be socially aware with a
compassionate human faculty. The Department of Humanities & Social Sciences was
established with an objective of making an engineer enlightened with adequate knowledge of
his/ her surroundings. The approach of the Department has always been interdisciplinary.

13.2 Academic Programme:

The Department of Humanities and Social Sciences offers undergraduate courses in English,
Costing, Economics and Management for the B. Tech. students and English for BS-MS as well
as BT-MT. The department also offers postgraduate courses in Economics to the M.Tech
students, English and Management to the MCA student and English and Economics to the MBA
students. Besides that the Department is also running Ph.D. programme.

13.3 Lab Facilities:

The Department of Humanities and Social Sciences has a language communication skills and
multimedia lab which is developed in collaboration with CACM, IIT Kharagpur. The lab which
functions on a carefully designed software ISILS WIRELESS interconnects all the students in
the classroom into an integrated and active mode of learning facilitating spontaneous interaction
among the students themselves along with the instructor. The lab concerns to bypass the
traditional lecture-based mode of learning and aims at rendering an interactive classroom
atmosphere with technological support to help students come to terms with the anxiety of
second language learning and channelize their latent linguistic competence into developing
communication skills.

Expenditure of @1.49 crore incurred for the work “supply, installation, testing and
commissioning of 15 lifts in “Staff housing, Academic Block and Director's Bunglow’ was
wrongly booked under Machinery and Equipment during 2013-14. Rectification entry was
done in 2014-15 and the amount was wrongly booked against “Construction of Central
Stores’ under Schedule-2 which resulted in overstatement of expenditure for ‘Const. of
Cenual Stores’ and consequent understatement to “Staff housing, Academic Block and

Director's Bungalow’.

Annexure to the Separate Audit Report on the accounts of the National Institute of
Technology, Agartala for the year 2014-15

1. Internal control system was inadequate due to the fact:

(i) Rectification entries to the errors and omissions feported in the SAR 2013-14
were not carried out by the Institute in full in the Annual Accounts 2014-15.

(ii) Supply order/Purchase order Register were not maintained by the Institute and
issue of revised/amended supply order were not disclosed by the authority during
the period of audit of accounts.

(ii) | Advances were booked as final expenditure and cash advances were not recorded
in the cash book.

(iv) Balances held under Sundry Creditors, Sundry Debtors, Advances to RD
Department, CPWD, EPIL and Other Agencies, etc were not brought forward
from the previous years and Leger Adjustments were done without making any
reference to the year of creation of such Liabilities and making any reference of
awarding advances to the above agencies, which makes the adjustment entries
unreliable to audit because of possible mistakes and omissions,

(v) ~ Outstanding Liabilities, Sundry Creditors, Sundry Debtors, Advances to different
Agencies etc. should be grouped under a Single Individual Ledger Account to
make the verification of closing balances easier.

(vi) “Classification of Expenditure’ was not made in the Cash Book from where
Ledger entries were made. As a result, mis-classification of Ledger Entries
leading to wrong booking of expenditure in the Annual Accounts could not be
ruled out in audit.

(vii) Lack of coordination between the Works-wing and the Accounts-wing was
evident from the fact that 21 works though completed and taken over during the
period from 05/2010 to 03/2015 by the Works-wing but reported as Work-in
Progress in the Annual Accounts 2014-15.

(viii) For day to day administrative functions the Institute is largely dependent on the
contractual staff. constituting 85 per cent of the total strength, due to non-making
of regular appointment despite having the sanctioned posts from the Ministry of
Human Resource Development in 08/2011. Non assurance of job security
causing frequent changes in the key posts which adversely affected the concept
uf continuity leading to absence of job responsibility, inordinate delay in
furnishing of records to audit etc. as noted during audit.

2. Adequacy of internal audit system:

Separate Internal Audit Wing has not been constituted till date although intemal
audit of the Institute was stated to be conducted by an Audit Officer but no audit
report was made available to audit.

could be produced to audit.

4. System of physical verification of inventory

2 It has been observed that Payments are made by cash in excess of Rs.20000/- Instead of account
payee cheques for incurring expenditures such as payments to visiting faculties, etc & this mode
need to be avoided. The Institute makes temporary advances from non plan funds which are
credited In the cashbook as advance. However it has been observed the adjustments are directly
booked In the ledger & in case of any refund from the advance the same |s treated as academic
collection. A separate advance register may be maintained & the armnount of advance taken &
adjusted should be routed through the register.

3. The concern prepared bank reconciliation statements regularly, However the following cheques
remaining uncleared as on 31.03.2015 requires reversal:

 
 
  

     

[cmon | oo‘ arm |

| 3 | 031021 02.08.2012 398,302.00
4 Fixed Assets: AS per the guidelines for Financial Statements for Central Higher Edu Institutions,

Fixed Assets should be valued at cost less acc depreciation & should be provided on SLM. But it has
been observed that the Institute is charging deprecation on WDV method with change in rates as
compared to the previous financial year.

Fixed Assets are not physically verified during the year & no insurance coverage against any fixed
assets Is taken by the concern. Daily average physical cash holding is around Rs.10.00 lacs,
maintained in the safe of the Institute for its recurring expenses however no risk coverage taken for
the same.

In certain cases of purchases of capital assets a penalty clause for delay delivery Is there In Wie
purchase order/ agreement with the vendor; however it has been noticed that in the following
though there was delay of supply of the items but the penal clause was nut Imposed by the
institute. The details of those were as follows:
