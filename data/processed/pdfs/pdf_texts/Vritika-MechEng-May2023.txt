The need for tribological study on artificial hip transplantation has been increased drastically for the past
two years due to the COVID-19 effect. Postoperative COVID-19 contamination is related with advanced rates
of cardiopulmonary problems, thromboembolic disease, renal injury infections in patients. The proposed
internship is to study the complex motion of hip implants and the effect of functional parameters. Using FEA
tool, the wear in implants will be studied and the effects of geometry, loading or lateral head displacement
will be examined. The stress and strain studies will be carried out and the tribological effect with the bone
surface will be computed for the implant.
