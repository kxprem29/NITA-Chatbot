25 credits and 800 marks for five theory subjects (comprises basic core, core and elective
subjects), two laboratory subjects and seminar; Second semester: 25 credits and 800 marks for
four theory subject (comprises basic core, core and elective subjects), two laboratory subjects,
comprehensive viva-voce and project preliminaries; Third semester: 10 credits and 100 marks;
and Fourth semester: 20 credits and 300 marks. Third and fourth semester of PG courses will
be fully devoted to project works. Minimum requirement of number of class hours for each
theory course is 40 hours per semester.
There will be continuous assessment of the performance of students throughout the semester.
Each theory subject in a semester is evaluated for 100 marks, with the following weightages.
Sub-component weightage:Continuous evaluation: 30 Marks (Attendance: 5 Marks, Quiz: 5
Marks, Class test: 10 Marks, Assignment: 10 Marks); Mid-semester Examination: 20 Marks;
and End-semester Examination: 50 Marks
The course curriculum of M Tech Seismic Science and Engineering programme is designed
considering the following six Programme Outcomes (POs):
PO1: An ability to independently carry out research /investigation and development work to
solve practical problems.
PO2: An ability to write and present a substantial technical report/document.
PO3: Students should be able to demonstrate a degree of mastery over the area as per the
specialization of the program. The mastery should be at a level higher than the requirements in
the appropriate bachelor program
PO4: An ability to identify, formulate and solve Seismic Science and Engineering related
problems using advanced level computing techniques
PO5: An ability to understand the impact of Seismic Science and Engineering solutions in a
global, economic, environmental and societal context

--- Page 3 ---
PO6: Ability to demonstrate the knowledge of Seismic Science and Engineering and
management principles and apply these to multidisciplinary environments.
The course curriculum of M Tech Seismic Science and Engineering programme is also
designed considering two Program Specific Outcome (PSOs).
PSO1: Analysis, design, investigation of complex problems in ways which are sustainable and
environmental friendly.
PSO2: Handling of any Civil Engineering projects ethically either as an individual or as a team.
Expert opinions are being taken in regular basis in order to improve the quality of teaching
learning process and to attain the programme outcomes efficiently.
In the Final year of M.Tech programmes (Third and Fourth Semesters) students may also opt
for industrial research. If any student desire to pursue his/her research in reputed industries,
he/she may be allowed to do so, provided:
a. The selected industry is a permanent member of NASSCOM, FICCI and other such
industry bodies.
b. The selected industry needs is approved by the DPPC of the concerned Department.
c. The student selects one supervisor from industry and another supervisor from the
Institute.
d. If any student opts for such industrial research he/she will not receive any scholarship
from the institute in this tenure, even if he/she wants to return back. In such cases the student
will be allowed to complete his/her project in the institute but without any scholarship.
