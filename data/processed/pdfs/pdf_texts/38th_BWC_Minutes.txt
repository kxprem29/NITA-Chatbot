38 BWC Meeting/ Minutes
March 15, 2017/ NITA

Item“No. 38.3: To consider various constructions activity already approved by the
Chairman, BWC for ratification by the BWC.

The Building and Works Committee ratified and confirmed the action taken in awarding work
mentioned in the agenda item No. 34.3 for all the proposed 12 (Twelve) items.

Item No. 38.4: To consider the action taken by determining the contract for
“Construction of lift well academic block at NIT Agartala/ Balance
work” by way of recession and execution of balance work estimated at
Rs. 11,32,179.00 (agreement value of the original work was Rs.
14,05,756.00.)

The Building and Works Committee approved the proposal to award the balance work of the said
lift well to the CPWD as deposit work along with the installation of other lifts of the institute.

Item No. 38.3: To consider approval for the work of “Supply, installation, testing &
commissioning of 14 (fourteen) lifts in Administrative Building 1 & 2,
School of Management, International Guest House, Academic Block
(ECE Deptt. & DoNER) and Central Library at NIT Agartala” at a
cost of RS. 4,17,13,490.00.

The BWC had considered the proposal for installation of lifts in the newly constructed buildings
of NIT Agartala in its 35th meeting held on 10th Feb’ 2016 for “Supply, installation, testing &
commissioning of 14 (fourteen) lifts in Administrative Building 1 & 2, School of Management,
International Guest House, Academic Block (ECE Deptt. & DoNER) and Central Library at NIT
Agartala” for open tendering based on the estimate prepared by the Institute at a cost of
Rs.2,67,34,665. In this respect several attempts have been taken to take up the works after
calling of open tender but no fruitful outcome has yet been achieved. The buildings are already
functional. It has been a very tedious task to climb fourth floor and above for PwDs and elderly
person. Considering the urgency of the work and in the event of not being able to select the
suppliers in spite of taking three attempts, it is opined by the Institute that the work may be
awarded to the CPWD as deposit work and CPWD was also requested to submit a cost estimate
for the above work. In response CPWD has submitted an estimate amounting to Rs.
4,17,13,490.00 including 3% contingency charges (rates are based on present market rates). The
estimate submitted by the CPWD includes civil works such as construction of Lift Pits in
Academic Block (DoNER Building), wall cladding of lift lobby of different building at NIT
Agartala and Comprehensive Annual Maintenance of 14(fourteen) nos. lift for one year. For the
said reason the estimated cost have been increased from Rs. 2,67,34,665.00 to Rs.
4,17,13,490.00. Earlier estimate was prepared by the Institute considering market rate of 2012,
whereas the cost estimate submitted by the CPWD is based on the prevailing market rate.

The matter has been discussed in the meeting of 38th Building & Works Committee held on 15th
March 2017. The buildings are already functional. It has been a very tedious task to climb the
4th floor and above for the PWDs and elderly persons.

The BWC approved the proposal for awarding the work of supply installation, testing and
commissioning of 14 (fourteen) nos. Lifts to CPWD as deposit work at a cost of Rs.
4,17,13,490.00. The Committee also recommended the proposal to FC and BOG for
consideration and approval.

38" BWC Meeting/ Minutes
March 15, 2017/ NITA
Item No. 38.8.4: To consider the proposal for installation of 14 nos Thyssen
Krupp (india) Pvt. Ltd. Make 13 passenger capacities lift for
construction of 1500 capacity Boys Hostel of NITA.

One 1500 capacity mega Boys hostel is under construction at NIT Agartala. It comprises of
7(Seven) Blocks G+7. As per provision of BOQ in each block 2(two) nos,13 passenger capacity
lifts are to be installed. Thus, in total 7x2 = 14 (fourteen) nos lifts are to be installed. M/s. NCC
Ltd. is the construction agency.

Thus, M/s. NCC Ltd. has offered a pre-dispatch inspection of 14 nos of 13 person capacity
passenger lifts of approved make of Thyssen Krupp (India) Pvt. Ltd.(TKED) as per the contract
Agreement Part-I, Volume I of III, Page No. 120, Clause No — 10.2 read with Clause No 1.1 of
Page No. 198.

Accordingly, 2 (two) officials of NIT Agartala were deputed for inspection of the materials as
specified in the Agreement, As per type test report of one item (product design code — TKSA,
Hollow Guide Rail), it is noted that the product is non-standard guide rail, it does not meet the
requirement of the standard JG/T 5072-3-1996.

However, as per literature available there is no IS standard for TK5A hollow guide rail which is
confirmed by the Thyssen Krupp (India) Pvt. Ltd. However, in ISO 7465 — 2007, clause — 6.2.2
(Table No-2-7) it is specified that Guide rails with other dimensions can be delivered on specific
agreement between the guide rail manufacturer and the customer. Subsequently, Thyssen Krupp
(India) Pvt. Ltd has stated that the dimensional requirement for TKEI is as per their product
requirement. So, it required to be designed accordingly (other than dimensional specification
elaborated in JG/T 5072, 3-1996) and all tests were carried out as per JG/T 5072, 3-1996.

It'is noted from the type test report that the parameter tested as per the standard JG/T 5072.31996
has passed.

As per standard JG/T 5072.31996, tensile strength should not be less than 370 MPa whereas the
test result is 469 MPa which is much higher than the specified standard limit. As per the
technical document review the guide rail materials and design standard or design drawing is also
passéd. .

Thyssen Krupp (India) Pvt. Ltd. has submitted an undertaking where they have assured and
warrants its best services regarding hollow guide rail performance and quality related matter.

From the above, it is clear that all the parameters are in order as per standard JG/T 5072.31996
and only dimensions are different which do not have ISO specification. NIT Agartala has earlier
