10.0 ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT
10.1 Introduction:
Department of Electrical Engineering is one of the enriched and primogenital
branches of engineering of the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Agartala
(formerly Tripura Engineering College, Govt. of Tripura). This Department has
been fulfilling the need of the state Tripura as well as the nation by developing
technical manpower in Electrical Engineering field since its inception in 1965. In
this long 55 years of journey, being a pivotal branch of the then Tripura
Engineering College, this department has witnessed many ups and downs. Still, it
has produced a great number of capable electrical engineers who in turn spread
their talent around various parts of the globe thereby enhancing the image of the
institute in general and branch in particular.
The Electrical Engineering Department started with an annual intake of 20 seats in
1965 and consecutively increased to 40 in 1981. After conversion of the Tripura
Engineering College into National Institute of Technology (NIT) in 2006, the intake
has been increased to 90 and this year (2019) annual intake has been increased
to 129.
10.2 Academic Programme:
Electrical Engineering Department has progressed noticeably with annual intake of
129 for 4 years (8 semesters) B.Tech programme and annual intake of 64 for 2
years (4 semesters) M. Tech. programme. Apart from B.Tech and M. Tech.
programme, Electrical Engineering department started Ph.D programme from
2008 academic session. Considering the aspiration of the students and keeping in
view of employment opportunity and prospect for research career, Department
has been offering four specializations in M.Tech programme, namely (a) Power
Electronics & Drives (b) Instrumentation (c) Power System, and (d) Integrated
Energy System. Further, excellent responses are obtained for Ph.D programme.
Several candidates from academic arena and industry show their interests for
pursuing their Ph.D work in the Department of Electrical Engineering and enroll
their names in the programme. At present 25 nos. (Part time & Full time)
candidates are carrying out their Ph.D work in the department. 05 (five) students
of the department have been awarded Ph.D degree in this academic year.
Academic Programme Goals:
The Electrical Engineering Department pursues the following primary academic
goals:
i. Create a healthy academic environment to promote the intellectual and
professional development of both students and faculties.
ii. Develop and maintain quality academic activities in UG, PG and PhD levels
which are commensurate with the mission of the Institute.
iii. Equip the students with theoretical and practical skills required for employment
in Government or private sectors, and admission to higher studies.

13.0 DEPARTMENT MANAGEMENT, HUMANITIES
& SOCIAL SCIENCES
13.1 Introduction:
The Department of Humanities & Social Sciences had co-existed with NIT Agartala
since the birth of NIT Agartala, i.e. when the erstwhile Tripura Engineering College
was converted to National Institute of Technology Agartala on 01.04.2006. The
Department was established with an objective of making an engineer enlightened
with adequate knowledge of his/her surroundings. The approach of the
Department had always been interdisciplinary. The Department offered
undergraduate courses in Economics, Costings, Management Principles and
Communicative Skills Development. Besides that, it encouraged the students to
actively take up research in various fields of Humanities and Social Sciences. The
Ph.D. programme of the Department was introduced to serve that very purpose.
The School of Management started its operation since July 2012. It had been
established to meet the growing aspirants of Techno Managers in the country
specially to meet the demand of North Eastern Region of the country. The School
of Management was offering Masters of Business Administration programme (Full
Time) and Ph.D. programme in management.
The Department of HSS (Humanities and Social Sciences) and SoM (School of
Management) have been merged into Department of Management, Humanities &
Social Sciences with effect from the academic session 2019-2020. The
Department of Management, Humanities & Social Sciences was established with
an objective of making an engineer enlightened with adequate knowledge of
his/her surroundings. The approach of the Department is interdisciplinary.
The Department of Management, Humanities & Social Sciences has a language
communication skills and multimedia lab which is developed in collaboration with
CACM, IIT Kharagpur. The lab which functions on a carefully designed software
ISILS WIRELESS interconnects all the students in the classroom with an
integrated and active mode of learning, facilitating spontaneous interaction among
the students themselves along with the instructor. The lab offers bryond the
traditional lecture-based mode of learning and aims at rendering an interactive
classroom atmosphere with technological support to help students come to terms
with the anxiety of second language learning and channelize their latent linguistic
competence into developing communication skills.

a well equipped Computer Laboratory. In this Lab, students perform practical
works in various subjects like IT and Business Skills, Finance, marketing and so
on. Students also perform research work in this computer lab. The Lab is also
equipped with a web camera and internet facility for interview purposes.
Computer LAB
13.2 Academic Programme:
The Department offers undergraduate courses to B.Tech students in Economics,
Costing, Management Principles, Management, Business Communication and
Communicative Skill Development and full time graduate programme in
Management. Besides that, it encourages the students to actively take up
research in various fields of Humanities, Social Sciences and Management.
The department is offering two year (four semesters) full time MBA programme.
This Programme is providing an in3depth understanding to students in technical,
human and conceptual skills, necessary for a successful manager with
specialization in different areas like Finance, Marketing, Human Resource and
System. The teaching strategy for this programme is oriented towards the
application of knowledge with live cases and teaching aids. There is a six-week
Summer Internship Programme (SIP) for students, after completion of first year
course to develop business acumen. The Department facilitates students to
undergo paid internships in various reputed government and private organizations
viz. RBI, NEDFi, SBI, NABARD, ONGC, HDFC, ITC, Senrysa Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
etc.
The Ph.D programme of the Department in Economics, Literature and
Management has been introduced to serve that very purpose. Along with these
diverse academic departments, the Department is home to a wide variety of
interdisciplinary collaborations, path-breaking research projects, and unique areas
of study. The ultimate objective of any education system is to produce human
capital who will be responsible citizen, besides excelling in his/her own domain. To
produce a complete technocrat, only technical knowledge seldom serves the

14.0 MECHANICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT
14.1 Introduction
The Department of Mechanical Engineering at NIT Agartala was formed in 1965,
when the institute started as a State Engineering College by the name of Tripura
Engineering College. Currently, the department has more than 375 students in the
B. Tech programme, 55 students in the M. Tech programme and 53 scholars in
the Ph. D programme, which are supported by 26 faculty members and 20 staff.
The Mechanical Engineering Department of NIT Agartala is privileged to be
commemorating a distinguished legacy of half a century of devotion pledged to
the cause of higher education in our Nation from its inception in 1965 along with
the foundation of the erstwhile Tripura Engineering College itself. Starting out with
a modest beginning, it now boasts of a large fraternity whose continuous and
indefatigable effort to this day have earned itself numerous coveted and
prestigious achievements. The department disseminates its academic scope
through its B. Tech. and M. Tech curriculum through the specialization of Thermal
Science and Engineering, Automotive Engineering, Manufacturing Technology and
Machine Design supported by 15 State-of 3the 3art research laboratories catering
to the various facets of research interests, the department envisages the
importance and relevance of live industrial problems in its PhD curriculum. A new
M. Tech. programme namely Material Science and Engineering has been
introduced from the academic session 2020-21 in collaboration with VNIT Nagpur.
Such a perspective to the necessities to be adaptive to the contemporary needs of
global engineering interests have resulted in unprecedented recognition of its
research potential evident from its research publications in eminent peer reviewed
journals, patent filings and several ongoing sponsored research projects and
consultancy endorsements from various Govt. and non-Govt. concerns.
Our Nation8s transition to a knowledge-based economy is requiring a new
generation of educated and skilled workforce for innovation and
sustainable growth. Its competitive edge is being determined by our ability to
create, share, and use knowledge effectively. The frontiers of a higher education
system are increasingly being challenged to remain contemporary to the needs of
the global requirements. Rapidly changing global technological requirements with
ever decreasing timescales of deployment, liberalization of our nation8s industry
along with increased social and environmental obligations are challenging the very
framework of our contemporary technical education system to provide an industry
ready taskforce. To be proactive rather being reactive to the demands of the
present and future requirements, the Mechanical Engineering Department of NIT
Agartala envisage a plan of action that is multi-faceted and is delivering its
objectives through contemporary and innovative models of education using the
best of all forms of technology, relevant and appropriate to regional expectations
and preferences. Extensive use of ICT based efforts are being put in place to
augment and enhance such training that will focus on identifying, developing,
promoting, honing and sustaining the inherent skills of our budding engineering
and technical professionals. It is through such initiatives that we endeavor to
prepare our students both at the Under-graduate and Post-graduate level to be
industry ready in the present era of emerging multidisciplinary career
opportunities. The Mechanical Engineering Department realizes its pivotal role in
providing a firm foundation in mathematical, scientific and engineering
fundamentals to its students which is essential to comprehend, analyze, design
105

and create innovative and novel solutions to real life engineering problems that
they are destined to encounter in their professional career. It has also been our
fundamental aspiration to inculcate the values of professionalism and ethics in our
students coupled with effective communication and multidisciplinary skills to
empower them with a strategic advantage on the platform of lifelong learning and
innovation. Furthermore, our societal responsibilities have been continuously
increasing. To meet these expectations, team effort and a dynamic work culture is
the need of the hour. The department realizes that enthusiasm, diligence and
commitment as the virtues that will guide our students to adapt to these
continuously changing expectations and help them embark on a road of sustained
excellence. Committed with a vision to produce high quality Mechanical Engineers
with techno-managerial ability to contribute in Industry and Research areas
maintaining professional ethics and values, the Mechanical Engineering
Department envisages a mission to create knowledge through research in the
science and technology of mechanical engineering by developing an effective
platform to share knowledge through educational programmes and the
dissemination of new discoveries. The Mechanical Engineering Department of NIT
Agartala envisions to develop the professional potential of faculty, staff, and
students by offering an inviting, nurturing, and challenging environment. This is
responsive to the intellectual, social, and cultural needs of a diverse learning
community. The Department advocates a research portfolio encompassing
traditional areas of mechanical engineering, as well as emerging and
interdisciplinary ones in order to foster creativity and critical thinking skills
through innovative research and design experiences. Awarded with the coveted
and prestigious NBA (National Board of Accreditation) accreditation for 3 years for
Under-graduate Courses, the Mechanical Engineering Department with such a
depth of its vision and mission, seeks to achieve its cherished goals of creating an
edifice of excellence in research and consultancy and to harmonize the values of
social upliftment through ethical and conscientious pursuance of the commitments
of engineering and technical education.
The major research areas include advanced/non-traditional machining processes,
aerodynamics, bearing design, CAD/CAM, combustion, composites, computational
contact impact analysis, computational fluid mechanics, computational mechanics,
convection, refrigeration systems, energy conservation fatigue, wear and failure
analysis, finite element methods, fracture mechanics, heat transfer, internal
combustion engines, materials processing and characterization, metal casting,
metal forming, multi-phase flows, nano-fluids, propulsion, renewable energy,
robotics, rotor dynamics, soft computing in design and manufacturing, welding,
tribology, turbo machines, turbulence, vibration etc.
Vision of the Department:

a carpet area of 727.18 SqM. Since then it has grown in size and content to take a
notable shape. In January 2018 the library has been shifted to its newly
constructed sophisticated building with all modern amenities for library readers. At
present the ground floor with 2282.00 sqm. and the first floor with 2282.00 sqm.
of the new building is being utilized by the library. Since the new building has
large floor area the collections have been arranged and separated department
