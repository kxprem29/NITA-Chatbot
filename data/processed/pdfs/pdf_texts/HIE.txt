Preface
Civil Engineering Department of NIT Agartala, awards the degree of Master of Technology
(M.Tech) in seven different specializations viz, Environmental Engineering, Geotechnical
Engineering, Hydro-Informatics Engineering, Structural Engineering, Seismic Science and
Engineering, Transportation Engineering and Water Resources Engineering.
The course structures of all post graduate degree programmes are carrying a total of 80
credits and 2000 marks. Semester wise distribution of course and credits are as follows: First
semester: 25 credits and 800 marks for five theory subjects (comprises basic core, core, and
elective subjects), two laboratory subjects and seminar; Second semester: 25 credits and 800
marks for four theory subject (comprises basic core, core, and elective subjects), two
laboratory subjects, comprehensive viva-voce and project preliminaries; Third semester: 10
credits and 100 marks; and Fourth semester:20 credits and 300 marks. Third and fourth
semester of PG courses will be fully devoted to project works. Minimum requirement of
number of class hours for each theory course is 40 hours per semester.
There will be continuous assessment of the performance of students throughout the semester.
Each theory subject in a semester is evaluated for 100 marks, with the following weightages.
Sub-component weightage: Continuous evaluation: 30 Marks (Attendance: 5 Marks, Quiz: 5
Marks, Class test: 10 Marks, Assignment: 10 Marks); Mid-semester Examination: 20 Marks;
and End-semester Examination: 50 Marks
The course curriculum of all Post-graduate programmes are designed considering the
following three Programme outcomes as formulated by National Board of Accreditation
(NBA)
PO1: An ability to independently carry out research /investigation and development work to
solve practical problems.
PO2: ability to write and present a substantial technical report/document.
PO3: Students should be able to demonstrate a degree of mastery over the area as per the
specialization of the program. The mastery should be at a level higher than the requirements
in the appropriate bachelor program.
PO4: An ability to identify, formulate and solve Hydro-Informatics Engineering related
problems using advanced soft computing techniques.
PO5: An ability to understand the impact of Hydro-informatics Engineering solutions in a
global, regional and local context which can convert into sustainable and contemporary
solutions.
PO6: Ability to demonstrate the knowledge of Hydro-informatics Engineering and
Management techniques along with clear principles for application in multidisciplinary
domains.
Expert opinions are being taken in regular basis in order to improve the quality of teaching
learning process and to attain the programme outcomes efficiently.
In the Final year of M.Tech programmes (Third and Fourth Semesters) students may also opt
for industrial research. If any student desire to pursue his/her research in reputed industries,
he/she may be allowed to do so, provided:
a. The selected industry is a permanent member of NASSCOM, FICCI and other such
industry bodies.
b. The selected industry needs is approved by the DPPC of the concerned Department.
c. The student selects one supervisor from industry and another supervisor from the
Institute.

d. If any student opts for such industrial research he/she will not receive any scholarship
from the institute in this tenure, even if he/she wants to return back. In such cases the
student will be allowed to complete his/her project in the institute but without any
scholarship.
