10.0 ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT
10.1 Introduction:

Department of Electrical Engineering is one of the enriched and primogenital branches of
engineering of the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Agartala. This Department has
been fulfilling the need of the state Tripura as well as the nation by developing technical
manpower in Electrical Engineering field since its inception in 1965. In this long 45 years of
its journey, being a pivotal branch of the then Tripura Engineering College, this department
has witnessed many ups and downs. Still, it has produced a great number of capable
electrical engineers who in turn spread their talent around various parts of the globe thereby
enhancing the image of the institute in general and branch in particular,

The Electrical Engineering Department started with an annual intake of 20 seats in 1965 and
consecutively increased to 40 in 1981. After conversion of the Tripura Engineering College
into National Institute of Technology (NIT) in 2006, not only the intake has been increased
to 90 but also this conversion has given a golden opportunity to the department to be
flourished in all the probable ways in order to boost up the teaching learning process.

10.2 Academic Programme:

Mlectrical Engineering Department has progressed noticeably with annual intake of 90 for 4
years (8 semesters) B.Tech program and annual intake of 54 for 2 years (4 semesters) M.
Tech. program. Apart from B.Tech. and M. Tech., Electrical Engineering department
started Ph.D program from 2008 academic session. The first batch of M.Tech in Electrical
Engineering has been started in 2008 with specialization in Power Electronics & Drives.
Considering the aspiration of the students and keeping in view the present trend of
employment opportunity in Power & Industrial sector and also faculty necessity in academic
field, two more specializations, namely (a) Power System and (b) Instrumentation have also
been introduced in M.Tech curriculum of Electrical Engineering from the academic session
2010-2011. The first batch of students of both the specializations has successfully completed
their course. Therefore, presently the department is offering M.Tech in following
specialization viz, (a) Power System, (b) Instrumentation and (c) Power Electronics &
Drives. Similarly, an excellent response has been obtained for Ph.D program. Several
candidates from academic arena and industry have shown their interests for pursuing their
Ph.D work in the Department of Electrical Engineering and enrolled their names in the
program, At present 30 nos. of candidates are carrying out their Ph. D work in the
department. It is worth to be mentioned here that the opportunity of this higher learning has
opened up an avenue for the in-house faculties and staff to obtain higher degrees for their
professional development without any need to go outside the state. Some seats are reserved
for institutional candidates in this regard,

Academic Program Goals:
The Electrical Engineering Department has goals for undergraduate, graduate as well as
Ph.D programs.

Advance Microwave Electronics, Non-Linear System Science, Modern era of Communication,
to mention a few. The Department aims to create competent Electronic and Communication
Engineers to serve the needs of modern advance technology and the nation as a whole. The
Department always updates the entire course curriculum on a regular basis after discussion
with academicians from institute of national repute and technologists from various renowned
organizations by which our students can compete with the best with respect to knowledge
and ability in the business and face the modern challenges of today’s Electronics and allied
industries and institutions where change is the norm. Among all branches of Engineering
Sciences, Electronics and Communication Engineering changes at extreme fast pace, so fast
that which is brand new product for today becomes obsolete in the very next day with
respect to science and engineering of this branch. Considering all the said aspects, the
Department possesses a qualified and experienced team of faculty members to carry out its
legacy. The major thrust areas of the department are VLSI and Nano-Technology, Nano-
Electronics, Microwave, linage Processing, Optoelectronics, Control Engineering and
Communication Systems, The Department has deeply involved in multidimensional aspects
of teaching and research under the able leadership of Dr. Sambhu Nath Pradhan, the present
HOD. The Department offers PhD. courses, full time as well as part time in Nano-electronics,
Microwave, VLSI, Image Processing, to name a few. It may be noted that the students of
this branch have been placed in various reputed R&D organizations, different eminent
companies, in India and abroad,

11.2 Academic Programme:

Separate Audit Report of the Comptroller and Auditor Ger eral of In
Accounts of National Institute of Technology (NIT), Agartala f r the i
31 March 2014 een

We have audited the attached Balance Sheet of National Institute of Technology (NIT),
Agartala as at 31 March 2014, the Income and Expenditure Account and Receipts and

Payments Account for the year ended on that date under Section 19 (2) of the
Comptroller and Auditor General's (Duties, Powers & Conditions of Service) Act, 1971,
These financial statements are the responsibility of the NIT’s management. Our

responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

z= This Separate Audit Report contains the comments of the Comptroller and
Auditor General of India (CAG) on the accounting treatment only with regard to
classification, conformity with the best accounting practices, accounting standards and
disclosure norms, etc, Audit observations on financial transaction with regard to
compliance with the Law, Rules and Regulations (Propriety and Regularity) and
efficiency-cum-performance aspects etc., if any, are reported through Inspection

Reports/CAG’s Audit Reports separately.

3 We have conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in India. These standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material
misstatements. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidences supporting the
amounts and disclosure in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of financial statements. We believe that our audit

provides a reasonable basis for our opinion,

4. Based on our audit, we report that:

i. We have obtained all the information and explanation, which to the best of our
knowledge and belief were necessary for the purpose of our audit.

ii, The Balance Sheet, Income and Expenditure Account and Receipts and
Payments Account dealt with by this report have been drawn up in the format approved

by the Government of India.

National Institute of Technology Agartala 183


--- Page 191 ---
Annual Report 2013-14

iii, In our opinion, proper books of accounts and other relevant records have been
maintained by the NIT, Agartala, in so far as it appears from our examination of such

books,

iv We further report that:
A. Balance Sheet

A.L.. Current Liabilities and provision (Schedule-6)
Sundry Creditors (Plan fund) -% 7.67 crore

(f) The above Sundry Creditors of % 7.67 crore pertains to the procurement of
machinery and equipment, computer accessories, books and journal ete. for which neither
the goods have been received nor billing was made by the concerned parties. This had also
included “Sundry Creditors’ of € 4.66 crore accounted for in earlier years not supported by

bills/vouchers etc. and no procurement was made till date.

Thus, providing for ‘Sundry Creditors’ without any supply/billing made by the agencies
resulted in overstatement of “Sundry Creditors” under the head “Current Liabilities and
Provisions” and also overstatement of “Stock in transit” under the head “Current Assets,

Loan Advances ete.” by % 7.53 crore at the end of 2013-14.

(II) The above does not include bills valued % 44.97 lakh received from four suppliers
during 2013-14 against supply of printed books. This resulted in understatement of sundry
creditors under the head ‘Current Liabilities and Provisions’ by = 44.97 lakh, Books” by
z 2.42 lakh and ‘Books in transit’ by % 42.55 lakh.

A.2.1 Loans & Advances (Plan fund) {Schedule-3 (ii)}- = 160.28 crore
Current Assets, Loans, Advances ete. (Schedule-10)- % 73.98 crore

The above includes expenditure of % 163.58 crore incurred by the implementing agencies
on the construction of different projects assigned by the institute and the bills against that

had also been accepted by NIT.

Therefore, inclusion of 163.58 crore as advances under “Loans and Advances” was
incorrect resulting into overstatement of “Loans and Advances” and understatement of

~Work in Progress” to that extent.

--- Page 192 ---
Annual Report 2013-14

A. 2.2 Current Assets Loan and Advances (Schedule 10)
Closing bank balance ( Plan Fund) -% 21.95 lakh

Three cheques valued % 16.65 lakh issued during the period from 31 March 2010 to
2 August 2012 were not presented in the Bank by the recipient for encashment and reflected
in the Bank Reconciliation Statement, prepared as on March 2014, as ‘cheque issued but
not presented into Bank for payment’. However, these cheques being time barred were
required to be reversed.

Thus, due to non- reversal of these three lapsed cheques, Bank balance and Sundry
Creditors was understated by 7 16.65 lakh. ;

-A.2.3. Current Assets, Loan and Advances (Schedule 10)
Earnest Money and Security Deposit- T 3.20 crore

‘The above includes an amount of % 0.30 crore being interest earned on Fixed Deposit and
Savings bank accounts maintained for Earnest Money and Security Deposit received from
various agencies. This resulted in overstatement of Current Assets, Loan and Advances and

understatement of “income” and capital fund to that extent.

A.3.1 Fixed Assets (Schedule 7)
() Capital work in Progress (Plan Fund) - % 335.61 crore

Nine works valued at % 11.27 crore were completed in 2013-14 or in earlier years but all
these works still appeared under “Capital work in Progress’, This resulted in overstatement
of ‘Work in Progress” by % 11.27 crore and understatement of Fixed Assets by % 9,39 crore,

depreciation by 1.87 crore, overstatement of Capital fund by & 1.87 crore.

(1) Machinery and Equipment( Plan Fund) - 745.33 crore

(a) The above includes expenditure of 2 1.54 crore incurred for the work “supply,
installation. testing and commissioning of 15 lifts in staff housing, Academic Block
and Director’s Bunglow” as on 31 March 2014. Construction works of these
buildings as well as installation of lifts were in progress till date of audit (September
2014).

This resulted in overstatement of “Machinery and Equipment” by 7 1.54 crore and
understatement of “Capital Work in Progress” to that extent. This also resulted in

overstatement of depreciation and understatement of Capital Fund by 13.12 lakh,

National Institute of Technology Agartala 185


--- Page 193 ---
Annual Report 2013-14

(b) — The above does not include Machinery and Equipment’s amounting to € 2,32 crore
procured during the year. The different lab equipments and other items received,
entered in the stock register and put to use, however, no accounting entries have
been passed so far. This resulted in understatement of Fixed assets and
overstatement of Stock in transit by % 2.32 crore.

On being pointed out in audit, the Institute stated that the amount has been included in

“Stock in transit” and the amount will be automatically adjusted with the release of

payments during 2014-15 as fixed assets.

(10) Library Books (Additions during the year) (Non plan Fund) - ¥ 0.77 crore

The above does not include books received on 15-05-2013 resulting in understatement of
library books under ‘Fixed Assets’ by % 2.42 lakh and understatement of Depreciation and
overstatement of Capital fund by % 0.17 lakh

B. Income and Expenditure Account
B.1. Accrued Interest on Fixed Deposits

Scrutiny of the Income and Expenditure accounts revealed that accrued interest on fixed
deposits amounting to 7 0.35 crore was not taken as income in the Income and Expenditure
accounts. This resulted in understatement of Income by Rs. 35.01 lakh with corresponding

understatement of Deficit ‘Capital Fund’,
C. Grant-in-aid

During the year the Institute had received % 118.25 crore (% 99.25 crore under Plan and
% 19.00 crore under Non-plan) from the Ministry of Human Resource Development. Last
years unutilised balance was @ 1.75 crore {Plan: (-) % 9.81 crore; Non-plan: & 11.56 crore},
Further, internal income of the Institute was = 16.03 crore. Against the total availability of
© 136.03 crore, the Institute could utilise only % 123.30 crore leaving unspent balance of
% 12.73 crore ( Plan: € $.31 crore and Non Plan: % 7.42 crore) as on 31 March 2014,

v. Subject to our observations in the preceding paragraphs, we report that the Balance
Sheet, Income and Expenditure Account and Receipts and Payments Account dealt with by
this report are in agreement with the books of Accounts.

vi. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations
given to us, said financial statements read with the Accounting Policies and Notes on
Accounts, and subject to the significant matters stated above and other matters mentioned

Annexure to the Draft Separate Audit Report on the accounts of the National Institute
of Technology, Agartala for the year 2013-14

1. Adequacy of internal control system:

(i) None of the entries made in the cash book was authenticated by the DDO as a
token of check.

(ii) There are several Bank Accounts maintained by the NITA without maintaining
complete list of Bank Accounts.

(iii) Budget Control Register was not maintained.

{iv) Separate record/register was not maintained to keep track of the receipt of bills
from the suppliers and payment made there against.

(vy) Ledgers and Journals were not authenticated by the DDO.

(vi) Fixed Deposit Register was not maintained properly and none of the entries was
authenticated by any responsible officer.

(vii) The liability of % 4.66 crore created in the earlier years for which material/goods
have not yet been received even after lapse of more than a year reflects a poor
internal control of the organisation. The NIT needs to conduct a review of all

', such liabilities created in the accounts and correct the accounts as it distorts the
true and fair view of statement of affairs of NIT. Further, the Institute already
had furnished utilization certificates in earlier years in support of utilisation of
Plan Grant which did not depict true picture of unspent balance and also it
resulted into misreporting to the Government of India.

(viii) Lab equipments and other items: valued % 2.32 crore received during 2013-14
were entered in the stock register but no accounting entries have been passed so
far which indicates lack of financial and accounting control.

2. Adequacy of internal audit system:

Separate Internal Audit Wing has not been constituted till date although internal
audit of the Institute was stated to be conducted by an Audit Officer but no audit
report was made available to audit,

3, System of physical verification of fixed assets
Physical verification of Fixed Assets was not done during 2013-14.

4. System of physical verification of inventory
Physical verification of Books, Journals, stationeries and consumables were not done
during 2013-14.

an

Payment of statutory dues
Records relating to recovery and payment of statutory dues were not maintained by
the Institute to ensure that no statutory dues were outstanding for more than six
months at the close of the financial year.
