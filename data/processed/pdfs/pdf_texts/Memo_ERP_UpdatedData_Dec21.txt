MEMO

The MIS section maintains in the ERP, data related to students as well as the employees of this
institute. The data relating to the academics and hostel are mostly used to prepare reports that
are frequently sought by the ministries of the Government. Data related to all the non-
academic transactions of the ERP are equally important for similar reports.

To maintain the authenticity of the data of the ERP, the employees of the institute should
upload relevant data in the ERP system. The users of the ERP should not communicate
verbally to the MIS section, on any occasion, to upload or modify any data. At the same time,
the officials of the MIS section, who have access to the database, are informed to update or
upload data after ensuring written approval from the head of the section related to the data.

This is issued with the approval of the competent authority in the file with an even number to
observe the contents of this memo in the strictest sense.
