10.0 ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT
10.1 Introduction:
Department of Electrical Engineering is one of the enriched and
primogenital branches of engineering of the National Institute of Technology
(NIT), Agartala (formerly Tripura Engineering College, Govt. of Tripura). This
Department has been fulfilling the need of the state Tripura as well as the nation
by developing technical manpower in Electrical Engineering field since its inception
in 1965. In this long 52 years of its journey, being a pivotal branch of the then
Tripura Engineering College, this department has witnessed many ups and downs.
Still, it has produced a great number of capable electrical engineers who in turn
spread their talent around various parts of the globe thereby enhancing the image
of the institute in general and branch in particular.
The Electrical Engineering Department started with an annual intake of 20
seats in 1965 and consecutively increased to 40 in 1981. After conversion of the
Tripura Engineering College into National Institute of Technology (NIT) in 2006,
not only the intake has been increased to 90 but also this conversion has given a
golden opportunity to the department to be flourished in all the probable ways in
order to boost up the teaching learning process.

10.2 Academic Programme:
Electrical Engineering Department has progressed noticeably with annual
intake of 90 for 4 years (8 semesters) B.Tech program and annual intake of 67 for
2 years (4 semesters) M. Tech. programme. Apart from B.Tech. and M. Tech.
Electrical Engineering department started Ph.D program from 2008 academic
session. The first batch of M.Tech in Electrical Engineering has been started in
2008 with specialization in Power Electronics & Drives. Considering the aspiration
of the students and keeping in view the present trend of employment opportunity
in Power & Industrial sector and also faculty necessity in academic field, two more
specializations, namely (a) Power System and (b) Instrumentation have also been
introduced in M.Tech curriculum of Electrical Engineering from the academic
session 2010-2011. The first batch of students of both the specializations has
successfully completed their course. Therefore presently the department is
offering M.Tech in following specialization viz. (a) Power System, (b)
Instrumentation (c) Power Electronics & Drives and (d) Integrated Energy
Systems. Similarly, an excellent response has been obtained for Ph.D program.
Several candidates from academic arena and industry have shown their interests
for pursuing their Ph.D work in the Department of Electrical Engineering and
enrolled their names in the program. At present 31 nos. of candidates are carrying
out their Ph.D work in the department. It is worth to be mentioned here that the
opportunity of this higher learning has opened up an avenue for the in-house
faculties and staff to obtain higher degrees for their professional development
without any need to go outside the state. Some seats are reserved for institutional
candidates in this regard. The department has awarded 05 (five) Ph.D degree in
this academic year.
Academic Program Goals:
The Electrical Engineering Department has goals for undergraduate, graduate as
well as Ph.D programs. In the 2017-18 sessions 5 students get enrolled in PhD
Programme.
The undergraduate program goal is to develop specialized proficiencies in the
concepts, methods, and tools required for entry level positions in Electrical
Engineering (EE) and for graduate and professional studies.
The master’s program goal is to develop specialized proficiencies in the concepts,
methods, and tools required for intermediate level positions in Electrical
Engineering and other professions and for PhD studies. Students may carry out
their thesis work, under the guidance of renowned and experienced faculty
members from other reputed technical institutes.
The doctoral program goal is to develop specialized proficiencies in the concepts,
methods, and tools required for high level positions and leadership in Electrical
Engineering and other professions. Coursework and teaching experience are
considered to be a significant part of graduate education.

13.0 HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES
DEPARTMENT
13.1 Introduction:
The ultimate objective of any education system is to produce human capital
who will be responsible citizen, besides excelling in his/her own domain. To
produce a complete technocrat, only technical knowledge seldom serves the
purpose. He/ She has to be socially aware with a compassionate human faculty.
The Department of Humanities & Social Sciences was established with an
objective of making an engineer enlightened with adequate knowledge of his/ her
surroundings. The approach of the Department has always been interdisciplinary.
The Department of Humanities and Social Sciences has a language communication
skills and multimedia lab which is developed in collaboration with CACM, IIT
Kharagpur. The lab which functions on a carefully designed software ISILS
WIRELESS interconnects all the students in the classroom into an integrated and
active mode of learning facilitating spontaneous interaction among the students
themselves along with the instructor. The lab concerns to bypass the traditional
lecture-based mode of learning and aims at rendering an interactive classroom
atmosphere with technological support to help students come to terms with the
anxiety of second language learning and channelize their latent linguistic
competence into developing communication skills.

14.0 MECHANICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT
14.1 Introduction
The Department of Mechanical Engineering at NIT Agartala was formed in 1965,
when the institute started as a State Engineering College by the name of Tripura
Engineering College. Currently, the department has more than 354 students in the
B.Tech. Program , 77 students in the M.Tech . programme and 39 Scholars in the
