Item No. 35.3 To consider the award of work “Up-gradation of the internal main road
with both side footpath including side drain, electric post, bus stop,
sitting arrangement at a certain interval & conduit from main gate-1 to
auxiliary gate-2 via housing and boys hostel & auxiliary gate-2 to main
gate-1 and auditorium to existing play ground (old) at NIT Agartala” at a
cost of Rs. 12,62,33,747.00.

The BWC strongly felt the need for taking up the work and observed the following:

The existing roads are without footpath (single lane standard) having 3 75 mir average width
and the condition of the roads are not good to cater to the present traffic volume The roads
connecting the NITA administrative building, Auditorium, Workshop, CRF Building, Hospital, all
the Boy’s and Girl’s Hostel, Guest House, Director’s Bungalow, Market, Sports Complex, Play
Ground, Quarters etc. need up-gradation. Once the roads are widened from 3.75 m width
(existing) to 7.00 m width (double lane standard) with footpath, the traffic volume will be well

accommodated in future.

The BWC also noted that the Estate Section prepared the estimate at a cost of Rs. 866.85 lakhs
based on TSR PWD 2011 for civil work and Rs 62 58 lakh for electrical work (which is based
on DSR 2012 (Elect), existing approved rates of NITA, TSECL store issue rate, market rate
analysis and price lists). Thus the total estimated cost stands for Rs. 929.43 lakh without cost
index Considering cost index @ 37.5% above on TSR-2011(PWD) for civil work and @ 48%
above on DSR-2012 for electrical work, estimated cost comes to Rs 12,62,33,747.00.

The BWC approved the estimate and suggested to start the work on priority, based on open
tender process (Three Bid System/ Three Envelope System) after administrative approval from

the FC & BOG The BWC also decided that after the tendering process is completed, approval

substitute items etc. in totality) in the work of Construction of Sports
Complex at NIT Agartala at a cost of Rs. 5, 34, 16,195.00.

On actual requirement and in order to maintain sequence of the work, variation occurred and

the variations are here under.

The total difference is (B-A) stands for Rs. 5,34,16,194.55 on higher side ie , 9 87% above the
agreement amount and within the permitted limit as per CPWD system.

  

   

   

During discussion, it was noted that some changes were made as per requirement and with the
approval of the Competent Authority, which are permitted during execution of civil works as per

CPWD system. The variations were unavoidable in view of the following reasons’

Topography of land (hilly area) and additional requirement of land

2. Deviation on BOQ items in RCC and reinforcement due to increase in length of retaining wall
and providing provision of retaining wall with counter fort (as per actual site requirement),
noted during execution of works.

3. Structural steel quantity are deviated following revisions of dimensions of span in the aquatic
centre from 36.00 meter to 42.00 meter to meet the national and international standard and
alternative option of structural steel and roof steel have been accommodated in lieu of sky

flex. In view of minimizing power consumption, UV rays protection in order to minimize the

temperature etc structural steel roofing with Polycarbonate has been recommended in lieu of
Sky Flex

Electrical work

As per actual site requirement, items on different sizes of underground XLPE ARMOURED
LT cable were required to be executed to maintain reasonable distance from 200 KVA sub-
station to main LT panel, Feeder pillar and road light pillar. This 1s the lion’s share of the
variation of electrical items due to increase of cable length

Fire Fighting’

Due to change of location of pump house, as per actual requirement 100mm dia. and 150
mm dia. ERW M.S. pipe are required to be increased in length in the gap between pump
house and other building. Further, one additional pump room added to cover-up the demands
of entire sports complex area. As such 3 (three) additional pumps (2 nos. 75HP and 1 no

15HP) and 1 panel board were required to be installed in addition

As per suggestion of the BWC, negotiations were conducted with M/S NCC Limited and they
agreed to reduce the rate in structural steel from Rs. 95.00 to Rs 9490 per Kg and
polycarbonate from Rs. 4445 00 to Rs. 4422 78 per sq m beyond 30% of the excess work on
these items as per BOQ.

Thus the overall quantified variation comes down to Rs 5,33,22,626 65 instead of Rs

5,34,16,194.55.

BWC accepted the technical reasons for deviations which were not avoidable for such large
size project related to Sports Complex and approved the quantified variation statement of Rs
5,34,16,194.55 for placing the same to FC and BOG for approval

ltem No. 35.5: “Construction of Central Lecture Hall Complex having 27 Class
Rooms at NIT Agartala”.

The BWC decided to defer the proposal due to paucity of fund, for the time being.
ltem No. 35.6: To consider various construction activities already approved by the
Chairman, BWC for ratification by the BWC.

The Building and Works committee ratified all decisions of Chairman, BWC (all the 13
