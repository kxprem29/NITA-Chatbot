Preface

Civil Engineering Department of NIT Agartala, awards the degree of Master of Technology
(M. Tech) in seven different specializations viz, Environmental Engineering, Geotechnical
Engineering, Hydro-Informatics Engineering, Structural Engineering, Seismic Science and
Engineering, Transportation Engineering and Water Resources Engineering.

The course structures of all post graduate degree programmes are carrying a total of 80
credits and 2000 marks. Semester wise distribution of course and credits are as follows:
First semester: 25 credits and 800 marks for five theory subjects (comprises basic core,
core, and elective subjects), two laboratory subjects and seminar; Second semester: 25
credits and 800 marks for four theory subject (comprises basic core, core, and elective
subjects), two laboratory subjects, comprehensive viva-voce and project preliminaries;
Third semester: 10 credits and 100 marks; and Fourth semester: 20 credits and 300 marks.
Third and fourth semester of PG courses will be fully devoted to project works. Minimum
requirement of number of class hours for each theory course is 40 hours per semester.
There will be continuous assessment of the performance of students throughout the
semester. Each theory subject in a semester is evaluated for 100 marks, with the following
weightages. Sub-component weightage: Continuous evaluation: 30 Marks (Attendance: 5
Marks, Quiz: 5 Marks, Class test: 10 Marks, Assignment: 10 Marks); Mid-semester

Examination: 20 Marks; and End-semester Examination: 50 Marks

The course curriculum of M Tech Environmental Engineering programme is designed
considering the following six Programme Outcomes (POs) and two Program Specific
Objectives (PSO’s).

List of PO’s

POI: An ability to independently carry out research /investigation and development work
to solve practical problems.

PO2: An ability to write and present a substantial technical report/document.

PO3: Students should be able to demonstrate a degree of mastery over the area as per the
specialization of the program. The mastery should be at a level higher than the requirements
in the appropriate bachelor program

Syllabus: M.Tech Environmental Engineering NIT Agartala

POS: An ability to understand the impact of Environmental Engineering solutions in a
global, economic, environmental and societal context

PO6: Ability to demonstrate the knowledge of environmental engineering and management
principles and apply these to multidisciplinary environments.

List of PSO’s

PSO1: Analysis, design, investigation of complex problems in ways which are sustainable
and environmental friendly.

PSO2: Handling of any civil engineering projects ethically either as an individual or as a
team.

Expert opinions are being taken in regular basis in order to improve the quality of teaching
learning process and to attain the programme outcomes efficiently.

In the Final year of M.Tech programmes (Third and Fourth Semesters) students may also
opt for industrial research. If any student desire to pursue his/her research in reputed

industries, he/she may be allowed to do so, provided:

a. The selected industry is a permanent member of NASSCOM, FICCI and other such
industry bodies.

b. The selected industry needs is approved by the DPPC of the concerned Department.

c. The student selects one supervisor from industry and another supervisor from the
Institute.

d. If any student opts for such industrial research he/she will not receive any
scholarship from the institute in this tenure, even if he/she wants to return back. In
such cases the student will be allowed to complete his/her project in the institute

but without any scholarship.
