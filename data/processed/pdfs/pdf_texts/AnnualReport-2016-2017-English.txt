10.0 ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT
10.1 Introduction:
Department of Electrical Engineering is one of the enriched and primogenital branches of
engineering of the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Agartala (formerly Tripura
Engineering College, Govt. of Tripura). This Department has been fulfilling the need of the
state Tripura as well as the nation by developing technical manpower in Electrical
Engineering field since its inception in 1965. In this long 50 years of its journey, being a
pivotal branch of the then Tripura Engineering College, this department has witnessed many
ups and downs. Still, it has produced a great number of capable electrical engineers who in
turn spread their talent around various parts of the globe thereby enhancing the image of the
institute in general and branch in particular.
The Electrical Engineering Department started with an annual intake of 20 seats in 1965 and
consecutively increased to 40 in 1981. After conversion of the Tripura Engineering College
into National Institute of Technology (NIT) in 2006, not only the intake has been increased to
90 but also this conversion has given a golden opportunity to the department to be flourished
in all the probable ways in order to boost up the teaching learning process.
10.2 AcademicProgramme:
Electrical Engineering Department has progressed noticeably with annual intake of 90 for 4
years (8 semesters) B.Tech program and annual intake of 54 for 2 years (4 semesters) M.
Tech. programme. Apart from B.Tech.and M. Tech. Electrical Engineering department
started Ph.D program from 2008 academic session. The first batch of M.Tech in Electrical
National Institute of Technology Agartala 71

Annual Report 2016-17
Engineering has been started in 2008 with specialization in Power Electronics & Drives.
Considering the aspiration of the students and keeping in view the present trend of
employment opportunity in Power & Industrial sector and also faculty necessity in academic
field, two more specializations, namely (a) Power System and (b) Instrumentation have also
been introduced in M.Tech curriculum of Electrical Engineering from the academic session
2010-2011. The first batch of students of both the specializations has successfully completed
their course. Therefore presently the department is offering M.Tech in following
specialization viz. (a) Power System, (b) Instrumentation and (c) Power Electronics & Drives
(d) Energy systems. Similarly, an excellent response has been obtained for Ph.D program.
Several candidates from academic arena and industry have shown their interests for pursuing
their Ph.D work in the Department of Electrical Engineering and enrolled their names in the
program. At present 38 nos. of candidates are carrying out their Ph. D work in the
department. It is worth to be mentioned here that the opportunity of this higher learning has
opened up an avenue for the in-house faculties and staff to obtain higher degrees for their
professional development without any need to go outside the state. Some seats are reserved
for institutional candidates in this regard.
Academic Program Goals:
The Electrical Engineering Department has goals for undergraduate, graduate as well as Ph.D
programs. In the 2015-16 session 4 students get enrolled in PhD Programme.
The undergraduate program goal is to develop specialized proficiencies in the concepts,
methods, and tools required for entry level positions in Electrical Engineering (EE) and for
graduate and professional studies.
The master's program goal is to develop specialized proficiencies in the concepts, methods,
and tools required for intermediate level positions in Electrical Engineering and other
professions and for PhD studies. Students may carry out their thesis work, under the guidance
of renowned and experienced faculty members from other reputed technical institutes.
The doctoral program goal is to develop specialized proficiencies in the concepts, methods,
and tools required for high level positions and leadership in Electrical Engineering and other
professions. Coursework and teaching experience are considered to be a significant part of
graduate education.

inculcated under the supervision of faculty members.
The department has at present sixteen energetic and dedicated faculty members consisting of
three Associate Professors, two Assistant Professors, seven contractual Assistant Professors
and four Teaching Assistants and it also boasts of hosting visits of a good number of
distinguished mathematicians every year. In their pursuit of research the faculty members
have covered a vast area such as Operation research, Transportation Problems, Inventory
Control, Fuzzy topology, Fuzzy Clustering, Fuzzy Logic, Neuro-fuzzy logic system, Grey-
fuzzy logic, Fuzzy dynamic programming, Fuzzy decision making, Rough Set, Numerical
Analysis, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Decision Making and Optimization, Mathematical
and computational biology, Bio-informatics, Fluid Mechanics. The Department has two
