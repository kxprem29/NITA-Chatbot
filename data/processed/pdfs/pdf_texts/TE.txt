Expert opinions are being taken in regular basis in order to improve the quality of teaching learning process and
to attain the programme outcomes efficiently.
In the Final year of M.Tech programmes (Third and Fourth Semesters) students may also opt for industrial
research. If any student desire to pursue his/her research in reputed industries, he/she may be allowed to do so,
provided:
a. The selected industry is a permanent member of NASSCOM, FICCI and other such industry bodies.
b. The selected industry needs is approved by the DPPC of the concerned Department.
c. The student selects one supervisor from industry and another supervisor from the Institute.
d. If any student opts for such industrial research he/she will not receive any scholarship from the institute
in this tenure, even if he/she wants to return back. In such cases the student will be allowed to complete
his/her project in the institute but without any scholarship.
