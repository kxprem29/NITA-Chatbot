HoD’s Message
The Department of Chemistry aims to be the best provider of chemical
education within the Northeast region and to be a leader in research,
publications and scholastic excellence. The Chemistry Department is
well equipped to run the under-graduate 1-year Chemistry course for
B.Tech along with 5-year dual degree BS-MS in Chemistry. Our goal is
to present the content of Chemistry set in a current and relevant context
for engineers also. As 1st year Engineering Chemistry course is taken in
Dr. Mitali Saha the B.Tech first year, we also have goals related to the improvement of
skill levels pertaining to the use of technology and communication. The
Associate Professor and
Chemistry department believes in and supports the study, teaching and
Head
understanding of chemical principles across a wide spectrum of areas:
inorganic, organic, physical, analytical, computational, nanotechnology,
etc. I hope you will explore our website to get more information
about our faculty profile and courses.
UG Coordinator’s Message
As a UG coordinator, I am happy to welcome to the aspiring
candidates interested in chemistry learning more about our UG
course curriculum and syllabus. The UG programme will help the
students not only acquire knowledge in science and chemistry, but
also to apply that knowledge in industry and academia to tackle
tomorrow's issues. This course will enable the students to acquire
knowledge by which they can achieve their goal in life. I hope the
Dr. Manojit Roy students will like our program and be motivated to join NIT
Assistant Professor
Agartala.

About Chemistry Department
The Department of Chemistry was started since the inception of the Institute. Over the years the
department has developed sufficient infrastructure to run the under-graduate and post- graduate
courses, viz., 5-year dual BS-MS, and 2-year M.Sc. The department has intake capacity of 13 students
per session for M.Sc program and 25 students per session for dual BS- MS program. The department
has successfully completed/ongoing 10 major research projects sponsored by DST, DBT, DAE-BRNS,
AICTE and CPRI.
Courses offered in the Department
The Department of Chemistry offers courses in 5-year dual degree BSMS, 2- year MSc, and PhD
programmes along with 1-yearEngineeringChemistrycoursein BTech.
Objectives to start the courses
The BSMS-Dual Chemistry syllabus has been created by following syllabi of various competitive
exams such as NET/GATE and other common entrance examinations. Candidates enrolled in the
BSMS Dual Chemistry programme at NIT Agartala will have the opportunity to acquire the
fundamental concepts in Chemistry from a devoted group of faculty members with extensive
experience in teaching and research. The students are being nurtured to become tomorrow's leaders in
their various fields.
Course Structure of UG
Student Intake
At present in BSMS-Dual degree course, there are 8 semesters with around 18-21 students in each semester.
In B.Tech course of Engineering chemistry –I, Engineering chemistry –II and Engineering Chemistry
Laboratory, there are 2 semesters and in each semester there are 12 sections containing 80-85 students in each.
Course Structure-Curriculum and Syllabus
The BSMS Dual course consists of a total of 159 credits –covering all the semesters (1st to 8th). In
these semesters, only theory and lab classes are conducted. B.Tech 1st semester (Engineering
chemistry–I and Engineering Chemistry Laboratory) has 4 credits (3 credit –theory and 1 credit-
laboratory) and 2nd semester (Engineering chemistry –II) has 2 credit.
