10.0 ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT

10.1 Introduction:

The department of Electrical Engineering is one of the enriched and primogenital branches of
engineering of the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Agartala (formerly Tripura
Engineering College, Govt. of Tripura), This Department has been fulfilling the need of the
state Tripura as well as the nation by developing technical manpower in the Electrical
Engineering field since its inception in 1965. In this long 45 years of its journey, being a
pivotal branch of the then Tripura Engineering College, this department has witnessed many
ups and downs. Still, it has produced a great number of capable electrical engineers who in turn
spread their talent around various parts of the globe thereby enhancing the image of the
institute in general and branch in particular.

The Electrical Engineermg Department was started with an annual intake of 20 seats in 1965
and consecutively increased to 40 in 1981. After conversion of the Tripura Engineering College
into National Institute of Technology (NIT) in 2006, not only the intake has been increased to
90 but also this conversion has given a golden opportunity to the department to be flourished
in all the probable ways in order to boost up the teaching learning process.

programme. Apart from B.Tech. and M. Tech. Electrical Engineering department started Ph.D
programme from 2008 academic session. The first batch of M.Tech in Electrical Engineering
has been started in 2008 with specialization in Power Electronics & Drives. Considering the
aspiration of the students and keeping in view the present trend of employment opportunity in
Power & Industrial sector and also faculty necessity in academic field, two more specializations,
namely (a) Power System and (b) Instrumentation have also been introduced in M.Tech
curriculum of Electrical Engineering from the academic session 2010-2011. The first batch of
students of both the specializations has successfully completed their course. Therefore
presently the department is offering M.Tech im the following specialization viz. (a) Power
System, (b) Instrumentation and (c) Power Electronics & Drives. Similarly, an excellent
response has been obtained for Ph.D programme. Several candidates from academic arena and
industry have shown their interest in pursuing their Ph.D work in the Department of Electrical
Engineering and enrolled their names in the program. At present 33 nos. of candidates are
carrying out their Ph. D work in the department. It is worth to be mentioned here that the
opportunity of this higher learning has opened up an avenue for the in-house faculties and staff
to obtain higher degrees for their professional development without any need to go outside the
state, Some seats are reserved for institutional candidates in this regard.

15.0 MATHEMATICS DEPARTMENT

15.1 Introduction:

The Mathematics Department is as old as the Institute (NIT, Agartala in 2006, formerly and
Tripura Engineering College) itself a venerable forty eight years of age, was established in
1965. It has always believed in striving for excellence in research and teaching and has
succeeded in this endeavor to a large extent. Growing steadily, today the department not only
teaches Mathematics to under graduate students of different Engineering Branches but
recently the department has also started two years M.Sc, degree course (Mathematics) in
which admission is made through merit basis with an initial intake capacity of 10 students. Also
the department has initiated to start 5-years Integrated M.Sc. programme in Mathematics in
2013. A syllabus revision workshop has been organized by the Department, for up gradation of
UG-syllabus and course structure / syllabus for M.Sc. programme to make a significant
contribution to research and development in Mathematics.

The Department has qualified faculty members consisting of three Associate Professors, two
Assistant Professors, two contractual Assistant Professors and five Teaching Assistants. In
their pursuit of research the faculty members have covered a vast area such as Operation
research, Fuzzy topology, Fuzzy dynamic programming, Fuzzy decision making, Rough Set,

16.0 PHYSICS DEPARTMENT
16.1 Introduction:

The Physics Department is as old as NIT Agartala (NITA in 2006, formerly Tripura
Engineering College) a venerable forty six years of age, was established in 1965. Since then, the
mandate of the Department has been to conduct teaching courses for students of engineering
disciplines and conduct interdisciplinary studies, especially with engineering departments. The
faculty members are engaged in rendering the post graduate and engineering undergraduates
with the fundamental knowledge of physics and problem solving skills, requisite for a bright
career, and striving tirelessly to improve the education further.

16.2 Academic Programme:

e The department currently offers the course of Engineering Physics to 1°, 2"! semesters of
engineering undergraduates (B.Tech) and Material Science to the 4" semester engineering
undergraduates of Electrical, Electronics and Communication branches.

* The department runs 4 semester master degree programme (M.Sc) in Physics. The unique
course structure of M.Sc, (Physics) blends well the areas of contemporary and applied
physics to create post-graduates who are equally comfortable with science and technology.

e The department also runs the PhD (Physics) programme.

The department has a vibrant research program (Ph.D.) in various frontline areas of research,
in addition to the present undergraduate and post-graduate prograrmmes. Recently three
research scholars have been admitted in Ph.D. Presently work is going on cutting edge topics
within the following major thrust areas of

¢ Applied Optics & Photonics

* Theoretical and experimental Condensed Matter Physics
* Experimental Plasma Physics

¢ Liquid Crystals

* Spintronics and devices

e Experimental Nano-science

18.0 SCHOOL OF HYDRO-INFORMATICS ENGINEERING

18.1 Introduction:

Water is an issue of strategic importance, with strong environmental, social and economic
implications, as expressed in global dialogues, such as the UN Millennium Summit, the World
Water Forum, the Bonn Freshwater Conference and the World Summit on Sustainable
Development. Modern water resource engineers and managers face increasing challenges in the
light of rapidly growing populations and competing demands for an increasingly scarce
resource.

One message is clear: the need for a more integrated approach to water and environmental
resources management calls for professionals with a high degree of specialization as well as
generalists equipped to lead and manage multidisciplinary efforts, individuals and organizations
in the water and environment sectors world-wide.

18.2 Academic Programme:
The M. Tech program offered by the School of Hydro-Informatics Engineering is a unique
interdisciplinary course in Hydro-Informatics Engineering in the North Eastern part of India.

To the best of our knowledge, such programme is presently being offered by only a few
Universities/ Institutes in the country.

The problems of water management in developing countries require integrated
interdisciplinary approaches rather than single track /stream approach which is normally
followed in undergraduate engineering courses. Therefore, the course contents of the M. Tech
programme has been framed focusing on interdisciplinary approaches. This integrates technical
aspect of execution of water projects with cultural, socio-economic and ecological peripheral
condition.

Thus the programme fulfils the requirement of adequately equipping the graduate engineer
with appropriate knowledge of Hydro-Informatics Engineering and thus enhancing their
professional competence for effectively solving complex problems in the realm of water (a
sector of National priority) on both regional and national fronts namely integrated,
management of water and waste water, flood and drought mitigation, river bank erosion etc.

The enrolment of M. Tech Students of the School for Ph. D programs in institutes of National
& International repute substantiates the quality/standard of M. Tech Course offered by the
School.
