chemistry of graphene oxide, Raman spectra and optical properties of graphene oxide,
photoluminescence property of graphene oxide, graphene oxide, quantum dots.
Application of Nanomaterials (10 L):
Waste water treatment by using nanoparticles, catalytic oxidation of CO to CO at lower
2
temperature by nanoparticles, nano composite materials for photochemical water splitting, for
solar cell and lithium-ion batteries, drug delivery; bio-conjugation; sensing.
Course Outcome
CO-1 Student will learn about various techniques to synthesis of scalable nano domain
materials and usage of chemistry for modern technology.
CO-2 Students will learn about the importance of nano carbon materials like CNTs,
graphene etc in modern science
CO-3 Students should be able to recognise application of fullerenes, CNTs, graphene in
energy harvesting system
CO-4 Student can be able to join a research group in nanoscience nanotechnology as a
student researcher having prior knowledge in chemistry of nanomaterials.
