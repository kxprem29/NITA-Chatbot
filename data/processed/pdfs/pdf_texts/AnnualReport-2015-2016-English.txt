7.0 CHEMICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT
7.1 Introduction:
The Department of Chemical Engineering along with its modern laboratory facilities offers
premier technical support to the students and the faculty members to improve their technical
skills and build upon their knowledge. Sufficient propulsive and proactive faculty members are
rendering their best services to build up the real educational atmosphere and academic journey.
Research laboratories are being developed as per present day cutting edge technology. Mrs Soma
Nag is the HoD of the department. The department is also mentoring the Bio Engineering
Department since its inception and Dr. T.K.Bandyopadhyay, Assistant Professor of this
department is acting as HoD for the Department of Bio Engineering.
The department had framed the course curriculum based on the need of today’s industries and
updates the entire course curriculum on a regular basis by organizing workshops, which are
attended by the academicians and technologists from IITs, NITs and institutes of national repute.
The department is exploring research opportunities in the field of Biofuels, Systems Biology,
Nanotechnology, Computational fluid dynamics, Environmental Engineering and waste
treatment, Adsorption, Polymer and rubber, Catalytic reactor, Membrane separation, Membrane
distillation, Liquid membrane, Artificial intelligence in Chemical Engineering from the existing
faculty members. Faculty members had initiated their research work after being funded by
several funding authorities such as DBT, DST, AICTE, TIFAC.
Faculty members are encouraged to attend abroad workshops/seminars to enrich their knowledge
through inter and intra scientific fraternity interactions. This year several faculty members have
also visited various universities, IITs and other institutes to attend seminars, workshops and
lectures. Presently, the department is furnished with more than hundred peer reviewed journals,
conference publications/proceedings and several book chapters.
Along with the academic curriculum of the department, the students are also involved in several
cultural, technical and sports events. Every year students from the department of Chemical
Engineering actively participate in Advaitam, the techno-cultural fest of NITA, and receive
hearty appreciation. Our students have also shown their spark at the Inter NIT Sports
Tournament held at NIT Calicut and NIT Allahabad. Alongside classes, we also organize an

10.0 ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT
10.1 Introduction:
Department of Electrical Engineering is one of the enriched and primogenital branches of
engineering of the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Agartala (formerly Tripura
Engineering College, Govt. of Tripura). This Department has been fulfilling the need of the state
Tripura as well as the nation by developing technical manpower in Electrical Engineering field
since its inception in 1965. In this long 50 years of its journey, being a pivotal branch of the then
Tripura Engineering College, this department has witnessed many ups and downs. Still, it has
produced a great number of capable electrical engineers who in turn spread their talent around
various parts of the globe thereby enhancing the image of the institute in general and branch in
particular.
The Electrical Engineering Department started with an annual intake of 20 seats in 1965 and
consecutively increased to 40 in 1981. After conversion of the Tripura Engineering College into
National Institute of Technology (NIT) in 2006, not only the intake has been increased to 90 but
also this conversion has given a golden opportunity to the department to be flourished in all the
probable ways in order to boost up the teaching learning process.

10.2 Academic Programme:
Electrical Engineering Department has progressed noticeably with annual intake of 90 for 4
years (8 semesters) B.Tech program and annual intake of 54 for 2 years (4 semesters) M. Tech.
programme. Apart from B.Tech. and M. Tech. Electrical Engineering department started Ph.D
programme from 2008 academic session. The first batch of M.Tech in Electrical Engineering has
been started in 2008 with specialization in Power Electronics & Drives. Considering the
aspiration of the students and keeping in view the present trend of employment opportunity in
Power & Industrial sector and also faculty necessity in academic field, two more specializations,
namely (a) Power System and (b) Instrumentation have also been introduced in M.Tech
curriculum of Electrical Engineering from the academic session 2010-2011. The first batch of
students of both the specializations has successfully completed their course. Therefore presently
the department is offering M.Tech in the following specializations viz. (a) Power System, (b)
Instrumentation and (c) Power Electronics & Drives. Similarly, an excellent response has been
obtained for Ph.D programme. Several candidates from academic arena and industry have shown
their interests for pursuing their Ph.D work in the Department of Electrical Engineering and
enrolled their names in the programme. At present 30 nos. of candidates are carrying out their
Ph. D work in the department. It is worth to be mentioned here that the opportunity of this higher
learning has opened up an avenue for the in-house faculties and staff to obtain higher degrees for
their professional development without any need to go outside the state. Some seats are reserved
for institutional candidates in this regard.

13.0 HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES DEPARTMENT
13.1 Introduction :
The ultimate objective of any education system is to produce human capital who will be
responsible citizen, besides excelling in his/her own domain. To produce a complete technocrat,
only technical knowledge seldom serves the purpose. He/ she has to be socially aware with a
compassionate human faculty. The Department of Humanities & Social Sciences was established
with an objective of making an engineer enlightened with adequate knowledge of his/ her
surroundings. The approach of the Department has always been interdisciplinary.
13.2 Academic Programme :
The Department of Humanities and Social Sciences offers undergraduate courses in English,
Costing, Economics and Management for the B. Tech. students and English for BS-MS as well
as BT-MT. The department also offers postgraduate courses in Economics to the M.Tech.
students, English and Management to the MCA student and English and Economics to the MBA
students. Besides that the Department is also running Ph.D. programme.
13.3 Lab Facilities :
The Department of Humanities and Social Sciences has a language communication skills and
multimedia lab which is developed in collaboration with CACM, IIT Kharagpur. The lab which
functions on a carefully designed software ISILS WIRELESS interconnects all the students in
the classroom into an integrated and active mode of learning facilitating spontaneous interaction
among the students themselves along with the instructor. The lab concerns to bypass the
traditional lecture-based mode of learning and aims at rendering an interactive classroom
atmosphere with technological support to help students come to terms with the anxiety of second
language learning and channelize their latent linguistic competence into developing
communication skills.
