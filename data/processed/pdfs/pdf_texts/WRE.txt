Preface
Civil Engineering Department of NIT Agartala, awards the degree of Master of Technology
(M. Tech) in seven different specializations viz, Environmental Engineering, Geotechnical
Engineering, Hydro-Informatics Engineering, Structural Engineering, Seismic Science and
Engineering, Transportation Engineering and Water Resources Engineering.
The course structures of all post graduate degree programs are carrying a total of 80 credits and
2000 marks. Semester wise distribution of course and credits are as follows: First semester: 25
credits and 800 marks for five theory subjects (comprises basic core, core, and elective
subjects), two laboratory subjects and seminar; Second semester: 25 credits and 800 marks for
four theory subject (comprises basic core, core, and elective subjects), two laboratory subjects,
comprehensive viva-voce and project preliminaries; Third semester: 10 credits and 100 marks;
and Fourth semester: 20 credits and 300 marks. Third and fourth semester of PG courses will
be fully devoted to project works. Minimum requirement of number of class hours for each
theory course is 40 hours per semester.
There will be continuous assessment of the performance of students throughout the semester.
Each theory subject in a semester is evaluated for 100 marks, with the following weightages.
Sub-component weightage: Continuous evaluation: 30 Marks (Attendance: 5 Marks, Quiz: 5
Marks, Class test: 10 Marks, Assignment: 10 Marks); Mid-semester Examination: 20 Marks;
and End-semester Examination: 50 Marks
The course curriculum of all Post-graduate programs are designed considering the following
three Program outcomes (POs) as formulated by National Board of Accreditation (NBA)
PO1: An ability to independently carry out research /investigation and development work to
solve practical problems.
PO2: An ability to write and present a substantial technical report/document.
PO3: Students should be able to demonstrate a degree of mastery over the area as per the
specialization of the program. The mastery should be at a level higher than the requirements in
the appropriate bachelor program
Expert opinions are being taken in regular basis in order to improve the quality of teaching
learning process and to attain the program outcomes efficiently.
In the Final year of M.Tech. program (Third and Fourth Semesters) students may also opt for
industrial research. If any student desire to pursue his/her research in reputed industries, he/she
may be allowed to do so, provided:
a. The selected industry is a permanent member of National Association of Software and
Service Companies (NASSCOM), Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and
Industries (FICCI) and other such industry bodies.
b. The selected industry needs is approved by the Departmental Postgraduate Program Co-
-mmittee (DPPC) of the concerned Department.
c. The student selects one supervisor from industry and another supervisor from the
Institute.
d. If any student opts for such industrial research he/she will not receive any scholarship
from the institute in this tenure, even if he/she wants to return back. In such cases the
student will be allowed to complete his/her project in the institute but without any
scholarship.
