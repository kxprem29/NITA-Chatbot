5.4 Design and Development Activities:
Brief and specific details of Process/ Instruments/ Equipment/ Software Designed and developed:
➢ Cellulose nanofibre (CNF) is a sustainable and nanostructured eco-friendly material. The high cost of
CNF, on the other hand, limits its use in a variety of applications, which can be overcome by developing
a suitable extraction technique and employing low-cost biomass. Bioproducts Processing Research Lab
(BPRL), Department of Bioengineering, NIT Agartala developed a technology to extract higher
crystallinity index cellulose nanofibre from Imperata cylindrica, often known as cogon grass and widely
available in Tripura. The purity of CNFs obtained from Imperata cylindrica is 94.36%, with a sellable
cost of Rs. 115.86 per mg
➢ Prodigiosin (PG) is a pigment that has been found to have antimicrobial, anti-cancer, and
immunosuppressive properties. The high cost of PG, on the other hand, limits its use in a variety of
applications, which can be overcome by developing a suitable production technique and employing low-
cost downstream process. Bioproducts Processing Research Lab (BPRL), Department of

also have goals related to the improvement of skill levels pertaining to the use of technology and
communication. We add to this a conscious effort to foster attitudes of lifelong learning and appreciation for
chemistry as a core of knowledge.
Department consists of students, research scholars, teachers and staff. Students and research scholars are the
backbone of the department. Success of our students and research scholars at the national and international
level is thus the motivation of teachers to guide them better and better. All faculties in the department are
highly educated with all having PhD degrees and a good number of publications. We are strongly motivated
to impart and enhance the advanced knowledge and skills of students and professionals to meet the global
challenges, to address rural needs through research and to offer effective solutions to the industries through
research and consultancies.
The Chemistry department believes in and supports the study, teaching and understanding of chemical
principles across a wide spectrum of areas: inorganic, organic, physical. Dedicated to excellence in graduate
and undergraduate education, the chemistry faculty teaches all lab sections and evaluates and grades all
assignments. Our department believes chemistry occupies a central position in the physical sciences. The
faculty and staff of the Chemistry department complement their love of teaching and learning with a strong
sense of community. Our department functions as an active community of educators and interacts closely
with our students. Working collaboratively, we strive to develop better capabilities in science and a better
understanding of the learning process. Most importantly, we sincerely hope our students acquire the skills
and confidence to become lifelong learners.

10.0 ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT
10.1 Introduction:
Department of Electrical Engineering is one of the enriched and primogenital branches of engineering of the
National Institute of Technology (NIT), Agartala (formerly Tripura Engineering College, Govt. of Tripura).
This Department has been fulfilling the needs of the state of Tripura as well as the nation by developing
technical manpower in the Electrical Engineering field since its inception in 1965. In this long 65 years of
journey, being a pivotal branch of the then Tripura Engineering College, this department has witnessed many
ups and downs. Still, it has produced a great number of capable electrical engineers who in turn spread their
talent around various parts of the globe thereby enhancing the image of the institute in general and branch in
particular.
The Electrical Engineering Department started with an annual intake of 20 seats in 1965 and consecutively
increased to 40 in 1981. After conversion of the Tripura Engineering College into National Institute of
Technology (NIT) in 2006, the intake has been increased to 90 and last year (2019) annual intake has been
increased to 129.
10.2 Academic Programme:
The Electrical Engineering Department has progressed noticeably with an annual intake of 129 for 4 years
(8 semesters) B.Tech program and annual intake of 64 for 2 years (4 semesters) M. Tech. program. Apart
from the B.Tech and M. Tech. program, the Electrical Engineering department started Ph.D program from
2008 academic session. Considering the aspiration of the students and keeping in view of employment
opportunities and prospects for research, the Department has been offering four specializations in M.Tech
program, namely (a) Power Electronics & Drives (b) Instrumentation (c) Power System, and (d) Integrated
Energy System. Further, excellent responses are obtained for the Ph.D program. Several candidates from
academic arena and industry show their interests for pursuing their Ph.D work in the Department of Electrical
Engineering and enroll their names in the program. At present 26 nos. (Part Time :13, Full Time: 12, Thesis
submitted: 1), candidates are carrying out their Ph.D work in the department. The department has awarded
04 (four) Ph.D degrees in this academic year.

13.0 DEPARTMENT MANAGEMENT, HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES
13.1 Introduction:
The Department of Humanities & Social Sciences had co-existed with NIT Agartala since the birth of NIT
Agartala, i.e., when the erstwhile Tripura Engineering College was converted to National Institute of
Technology Agartala on 01.04.2006. The Department was established with an objective of making an
engineer enlightened with adequate knowledge of his/her surroundings. The approach of the Department had
always been interdisciplinary. The Department offered undergraduate courses in Economics, Costings,
Management Principles and Communicative Skill Development. Besides that, it encouraged the students to
actively take up research in various fields of Humanities and Social Sciences. The Ph.D. programme of the
Department was introduced to serve that very purpose.
The School of Management started its operation in July 2012. It had been established to meet the growing
aspirants of Techno Managers in the country specially to meet the demand of North Eastern Region of the
country. The School of Management was offering Masters of Business Administration programme (Full
Time) and Ph.D. programme in management.
The Department of HSS (Humanities and Social Sciences) and SoM (School of Management) have been
merged into Department of Management, Humanities & Social Sciences with effect from the academic
session 2019-2020. The Department of Management, Humanities & Social Sciences was established with an
objective of making an engineer enlightened with adequate knowledge of his/her surroundings. The approach
of the Department is interdisciplinary.
The Department of Management, Humanities & Social Sciences has a language communication skills and
multimedia lab which is developed in collaboration with CACM, IIT Kharagpur. The lab which functions
on a carefully designed software ISILS WIRELESS interconnects all the students in the classroom with an
integrated and active mode of learning, facilitating spontaneous interaction among the students themselves
along with the instructor. The lab offers beyond the traditional lecture-based mode of learning and aims at
rendering an interactive classroom atmosphere with technological support to help students come to terms
with the anxiety of second language learning and channelize their latent linguistic competence into
developing communication skills.
Language LAB
The Department of Management, Humanities and Social Sciences (MHSS) also has a well-equipped
Computer Laboratory. In this Lab, students perform practical works in various subjects like IT and Business
Skills, Finance, marketing and so on. Students also perform research work in this computer lab. The Lab is
also equipped with a web camera and internet facility for interview purposes.

14.0 MECHANICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT
14.1 Introduction
The Department of Mechanical Engineering at NIT Agartala was formed in 1965, when the institute started
as a State Engineering College by the name of Tripura Engineering College. Currently, the department has
more than448 students in the B. Tech. programme,9 students in the M.Tech. program and 44 Scholars in the
Ph.D. program, which are supported by 30 faculty members and 19 staff.
The Mechanical Engineering Department of NIT Agartala is privileged to be commemorating a distinguished
legacy of half a century of devotion pledged to the cause of higher education in our Nation from its inception
in 1965 along with the foundation of the erstwhile Tripura Engineering College itself. Starting out with a
modest beginning, it now boasts of a large fraternity whose continuous and indefatigable efforts to this day
has earned itself numerous coveted and prestigious achievements .The department disseminates its academic
scope through its B.Tech. and M.Tech curriculum through the specialization of Thermal Science and
Engineering, Automotive Engineering, Manufacturing Technology and Machine Design supported by 16
State-of 3the 3Art research laboratories catering to the various facets of research interests, the department
envisages the importance and relevance of live industrial problems in its PhD curriculum. Such a perspective
to the necessities to be adaptive to the contemporary needs of global engineering interests have resulted in
unprecedented recognition of its research potential, evident from its research publications in eminent peer
reviewed journals, patent filings and several ongoing sponsored research projects and consultancy
endorsements from various Govt. and non-Govt. concerns.
Our Nation9s transition to a knowledge-based economy is requiring a new generation of educated and skilled
workforce for innovation and sustainable growth. Its competitive edge is being determined by our ability to
create, share, and use knowledge effectively. The frontiers of a higher education system are increasingly
being challenged to remain contemporary to the needs of the global requirements. Rapidly changing global
technological requirements with ever decreasing timescales of deployment, liberalization of our nation9s
industry along with increased social and environmental obligations are challenging the very framework of
our contemporary technical education system to provide an industry ready taskforce. To be proactive rather
being reactive to the demands of the present and future requirements, the Mechanical Engineering
Department of NIT Agartala envisage a plan of action that is multi-faceted and is delivering its objectives
through contemporary and innovative models of education using the best of all forms of technology, relevant
and appropriate to regional expectations and preferences. Extensive use of ICT based efforts are being put
in place to augment and enhance such training that will focus on identifying, developing, promoting, honing
and sustaining the inherent skills of our budding engineering and technical professionals. It is through such
initiatives that we endeavor to prepare our students both at the Under-graduate and Post-graduate level to be
industry ready in the present era of emerging multidisciplinary career opportunities. The Mechanical
Engineering Department realizes its pivotal role in providing a firm foundation in mathematical, scientific
and engineering fundamentals to its students which is essential to comprehend, analyze, design and create
innovative and novel solutions to real life engineering problems that they are destined to encounter in their
professional career. It has also been our fundamental aspiration to inculcate the values of professionalism
and ethics in our students coupled with effective communication and multidisciplinary skills to empower
them with a strategic advantage on the platform of lifelong learning and innovation. Furthermore, our societal
responsibilities have been continuously increasing. To meet these expectations, team effort and a dynamic
work culture is the need of the hour. The department realizes that enthusiasm, diligence and commitment as
the virtues that will guide our students to adapt to these continuously changing expectations and help them
embark on a road of sustained excellence. Committed with a vision to produce high quality Mechanical
Engineers with techno- managerial ability to contribute in Industry and Research areas maintaining
professional ethics and values, the Mechanical Engineering Department envisages a mission to create
knowledge through research in the science and technology of mechanical engineering by developing an
effective platform to share knowledge through educational programs and the dissemination of new
discoveries. The Mechanical Engineering Department of NIT Agartala envisions to develop the professional

potential of faculty, staff, and students by offering an inviting, nurturing, and challenging environment. This
is responsive to the intellectual, social, and cultural needs of a diverse learning community. The Department
advocates a research portfolio encompassing traditional areas of mechanical engineering, as well as emerging
and interdisciplinary ones in order to foster creativity and critical thinking skills through innovative research
and design experiences. Awarded with the coveted and prestigious NBA (National Board of Accreditation)
accreditation for 5 years for Under-graduate Courses, the Mechanical Engineering Department with such a
depth of its vision and mission, seeks to achieve its cherished goals of creating an edifice of excellence in
research and consultancy and to harmonize the values of social upliftment through ethical and conscientious
pursuance of the commitments of engineering and technical education.
The major research areas include advanced / non-traditional machining processes, aerodynamics, bearing
design, CAD/CAM, combustion, composites, computational contact impact analysis, computational fluid
mechanics, computational mechanics, convection, refrigeration systems, energy conservation fatigue, wear
and failure analysis, finite element methods, fracture mechanics, heat transfer, internal combustion engines,
materials processing and characterization, metal casting, metal forming, multi-phase flows, nano-fluids,

15.0 MATHEMATICS DEPARTMENT
15.1 Introduction:
The Department of Mathematics starts from the inception of NIT Agartala in 2006 with the up gradation of
erstwhile Tripura Engineering College (TEC). The Department is motivated towards excellence in research
and teaching and has accomplished in this venture continuously over the years to a large extent. Initially, the
Department catered the need of teaching Engineering Mathematics to the undergraduate students. In 2010,
the Department made a big stride in the way of starting Post Graduate course, namely M.Sc. in Mathematics.
Further expansion of the Department in the form of opening BSMS, a 5 years dual degree course in 2013
was really a milestone in the history of the Department. Since then, it started functioning as a full-fledged
department in true sense. In 2020 and 2021, another post graduate course, namely M.Sc. in Mathematics and
Computing and 5-year dual degree course, namely BTMT in Computational Mathematics were started. At
present, the Department is offering M.Sc. course in Mathematics and Computing, BSMS in Mathematics,
BSMS in Mathematics and Computing and BTMT in Computational Mathematics and also Ph.D. Programs
in (both Pure & Applied) Mathematics. Apart from teaching Engineering Mathematics, the faculty members
teach various other subjects, like Operations Research, Numerical Analysis, Computational Linear Algebra
etc. to under graduate and post graduate engineering students. The faculty members are involved in extensive
individual and collaborative research work.
Departmental Computer Lab Students working in Computer Lab
15.2 Academic Programme:
For imparting quality education, both PG and UG level courses (M.Sc. in Mathematics and Computing,
BSMS in Mathematics, BSMS in Mathematics & Computing and BTMT in Computational Mathematics)
are taught in Mathematics Department. Admission in the two years (4 Semester) M.Sc. Degree and five
years (10 Semesters) BSMS and BTMT Courses are made through merit basis with an initial intake capacity
of 13, 25 and 25 students (respectively). Both of these M.Sc. and Dual Degree Programs encourage and
persuade the students to grasp in depth knowledge and also widen their career opportunities. Also the
Department offers Ph.D. Degree in Mathematics.
15.3 Faculty and their Activities:
The Department has highly qualified faculty members consisting of one (01) Professor, four (04) Associate
Professors, one (01) Assistant Professor (Regular) and ten (10) Assistant Professors (Contractual). In their
pursuit of research, the faculty members are doing an extensive study in vast and diverse fields relating to

18.0 CENTRAL LIBRARY
18.1 Introduction:
NIT Agartala Central Library inherited some of its resources from the then Tripura Engineering College,
controlled and managed by Dept. of Higher education, Govt. of Tripura in 2006. In 2010 the Central Library
shifted to a building with a carpet area of 727.18 Sqm. Since then, it has grown in size and content to take a
notable shape. In January 2018, the library has been shifted to its newly constructed sophisticated building
with all modern amenities for library readers. At present, the ground floor with 2282.00 sqm. and the first
floor with 2282.00 sqm. of the new building is being utilized by the library. Since the new building has a
large floor area, the collections have been arranged and separated department-wise for easy searching of
books. It has a separate non-book section, reserved section and foreign books section. A separate non-book
section is open for the benefit of the PG and PhD scholars and faculty members of the institute. The library
is at present equipped with facilities and resources in the forms of books, e-journals, dissertations, thesis, CD
ROM, back volumes journals etc. Purified water facility and ample lit space for reading with adequate sitting
capacity are provided on both floors to make an aesthetic appeal to the library users. It has a separate
conference room with 20 seating capacity. The library is covered with CCTV surveillance system. The
library is also equipped with lift facility for easy access to different floors of the library building.
The library is equipped with a RFID system to ensure security, automated issue & return of books, self-
check-in & check-out facility and tracking of tagged library materials. More than 40000 selected volumes of
books have been 'RFID tagged'. The process is going on for tagging the library's entire collection under the
RFID system. The library is now functioning to attain the goal of creating knowledgeable persons in society
and providing modern library facilities to its readers.

construction Board (THCB - { 0.76 crore), which are lying unadjusted for more than l0
years. The details regarding advance made to BSNL was not made available to audit. It was
also seen that a total advance amount of { 10'71 crore was made to THCB between April
2008 and November 2010 for construction of Academic Block, Library Media Centre and
construction of 2"d floor at New Computer Science Building. However, the Institute is yet to
receive Utilization certificate amounting to { 0.76 crore till date. No colrespondence was
found on record on this matter after August 2019' Since these are very old advances and
recordsregardingSomearenotavailablewiththeManagement,thechancesofmaking

against the same to reflect a true and fair view in the Accounts. The non-provision ing for

ANNEXURE TO THE MANAGEMENT LETTER
t
1. The Institute during its formation in 2006 has taken over net assets worth 16.08
crore from erstr,l'hile Tripura Engineering College. However, the Institute is yet to
incorporate these assets and tiabilities into its accounts even though it is in possession
of the same.
2. (D A balance of 14.49 lakh held with Canara Bank (Non-Plan Account No. -
XXXX0876) is being carried in the books of the Institute for more than 10 years. The
Institute has also been losing interest on the amount as it is kept in a non-interest-
bearing account.
(ii) The Institute has another account under NIT Transit House Fund with State Bank
of India (A"/c No. - xxxx6l95) which has also become inoperative as a result of no
transactions being carried out.
As such, the need for carrying on with the dormant/ inoperative accounts may be
reviewed by the Management.
3. (i) An amount of { 43.10 crore was not shown under the head "Addition during the
year" and was wrongly showed as "Income from Investments made of the Funds"
under Corpus Fund.
(ii) An amount of { 16.76 crore was wrongly shown as "lncome from Investments
made of the Funds,, instead of showing under the head "Addition during the year"
under Retirement Benefit Fund.
(iii) An amount of { 6.83 lakh was wrongly shown as "lncome from Investments
made of the Funds" instead of showing t 6.25 lakh under the head "Addition during
the year" and t 0.58 lakh "Interest on Savings account" under Infrastructure
Development Fund.
4. Payment of GPF contribution amount of t 0.17 crore made to Sri Niranjan Ghosh
(March 2023), was neither shown as "Addition during the year" nor as "Revenue
Expenditure" under Retirement Benefit Fund.
5. Expenditure amounting to { 0.06 crore pertaining to the year 2021-22 was wrongly
booked under ..Administrative and General expenses" (Schedule - 17) rather than
under "Prior period expenses" (Schedule - 22).
6. The income of Educational lnstitutions is exempt from Income Tax under the
provisions of Section t0 (23 c) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. During 2022-23, the
bankers of the National Institute ofTechnotogy, Agartala (NITA) had deducted a sum
aggregating to 167.62 lakh on account of "Tax Deducted at Source (TDS)" on the
inrerest income eamed by NITA on the Fixed Deposits (FD) maintained with the said
banks (i.e. state Bank of India and Tripura Gramin Bank). Furthermore, other
{
agencies had deducted a sum aggregating to 0.86 takh as TDS on the payments
made to NITA. NITA secured an Income Exemption certificate from the Income Tax
Departmenr under the provisions of 10 (23c) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for the
FYs 2021-22 to 2023-24. However, despite having the exemption certificate, it did not
ensure the effective implementation of the same.

--- Page 233 ---
7. As per Format ol the Ministry, where an Institute has a separate Corpus Fund as an
Earmarked Fund, the heading in the Balance Sheet and in the Schedule concemed
should be changed as "Capital Fund" to avoid confusion. The Institute, however,
retained the heading on the face of Balance Sheet as "Corpus/ Capital Fund" despite
having a separate "Corpus Fund" under Designated/ Earmarked Fund (Schedule 2).
8. In Schedule - 4 (Fixed Assets), the second column under the head "Depreciation"
mentions "On additions during the year" which is incorrect as the column provides
details of depreciation provided during the year. The column head should read
"Depreciation for the year" as per the approved Format.
9. As per the approved Format, Fixed Assets created out of Plan funds and Non-plan
funds are to be exhibited distinctly. The additions during the year from Plan, Non-plan
and other funds and the depreciation on those additions respectively are to be
exhibited distinctty in Sub-schedules A, B, C and D to the main schedule of Fixed
Assets (Schedule-4). However, the same was not followed properly by the Institute.
The words "Non-plan Fund" is mentioned under the head "lntangible Assets", but no
such segmentation is provided under the head "Tangible Assets". Further the Sub-
schedules as mentioned before have also not been provided in the Accounts.
10. In terms of instructions and accounting principles, the amount of caution money
refundable to students during 12 months from the balance sheet date should be shown
in the following manner:
o
From current students
r
From ex-students
But it was noticed from the Schedule-3 of the Annual Accounts that caution money
was shown under two separate heads, viz. "Deposits from students" (u'hich represents
Library caution money) and "Hostel caution money" instead of showing bifurcation of
caution money refundable to students in the aforesaid manner, thus being in
contravention to the prescribed format.
ll. The Institute has shown an amount of t 1.93 crore as "All other Fees" under
Academic Collection which should be bifurcated, as per the MHRD format
requirement.
12. (i) The Transit House Fund (SBI A./c No. - XXXX6195) held with Kunjavan Branch
has been wrongly shown in the accounts under the Current Assets (Schedule - 7) as
held with N/77 Branch.
(ii) The Non-Plan Fund (Canara Bank A/c No. - XXXX0876) is a Current Account
but has been wrongly categorized as Savings Accounts under the Current Assets
(Schedule - 7).
Balance Sheet - Application of Funds - Investment from Earmarked /
t
Endowment Funds (Schedule - 5) - 168.01 crore
13. The above includes "Mutual Fund with SBI, NITA Branch - NITA Corpus Fund"
amounting to {5 crore. Scrutiny of records revealed that an amount of { 5 crore was
invested in SBI Savings Fund during November 2020. However, the amount was
initially switched out on 22 March 2021 to SBI Banking & PSU Fund and again on

--- Page 234 ---
12 J,nary 2023 ro SBI Magnum Income Fund. As switch-outs from a particular
Mutual Fund (MF) scheme are treated as redemption and switch-ins are tieated as
new investments, the face value (investment amount) changes each time switch-outs
are done from any scheme. As such, the investment amount (cost price) of the
Mutual Fund as on 31 March 2023 stands at { 5.39 crore while the income ieceived
from the investment (capital gain) is { 0.39 crore. The value of the MF as on
3l March 2023 stands at { 5.45 crore thereby having an accrued income of { 0.06
crore. The Institute has accounted for an accrued income of { 0.25 crore on the MF
on an arbitrary basis. Hence, "Mutual Fund with SBI, NITA Branch - NITA Corpus
Fund" is understated by t 0.39 crore, "Interest received on Investments', is
understated by { 0.39 crore while "Accrued Interest on Investment,,is overstated bv
{ 0. l9 crore.
Application of Funds- Investment from Earmarked/ Endowment Funds
(Schedule - 5) - { 168.01 crore - Fixed Deposits with scheduled banks - t 16.0f
crore
14. The above is overstated by t 5.36 lakh due to wrong accounting of face value ofone
Fixed Deposit (FD) held with State Bank of India, NITA Branch under ..Retiremenr
Benefit Fund" (FD No. 30359168928). The face value ofthe FD as on 3l March 2023
t
stands at 28.98 lakh while the Institute entered the face value as { 34.34 lakh, which
is the value ofthe FD as on 02 April2023 (FY 2023-24) on renewal. The Institute has
accounted the entire interest of { 3.91 lakh as "Interest received" (Interest received
{ 5.36 lakh minus opening accrued interest of one year { L45 lakh) while an
(
additional "Accrued interest" of 1.72 lakh has also been accounted for. However,
the lnstitute should have accounted for an "Accrued Interest" of { 1.79 lakh for the
FY 2022-23 while there was no interest received as the FD did not mature during the
year. As such, the "Fixed Deposits with scheduled banks" is overstated by { 5.36
lakh, "Interest received on FD" is overstated by { 3.91 lakh (after adjusting for
opening accrued interest of { 1.45 lakh) while "Accrued interest on FD" is
t
understated by 0.07 lakh.
Sources of Funds- Current Liabilities and Provision (Schedule -3) - t. 13.54
crore
15. The above is understated by 117.62 lakh due to non-provision of expenditures
pertaining to the financial year 2022-23 which were paid during 2023-24. This also
resulted in overstatement of"Excess of Income over Expenditure" for the current year
by the same amount.
