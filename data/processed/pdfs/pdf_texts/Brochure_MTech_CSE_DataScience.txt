Program Outcomes (POs) & © — | @ e

@

PO1!: To develop the Bik to apply knowledge of mathematics, engineering
sciences for conductingindependent research/investigation for solving practical
problems.
PO2: To develop the ability to identify, formulate, conduct experiments, interpret
data, synthesize information, and analyze engineering problems by writing and
presenting an effective technical report /document.
POS: To develop the ability to demonstrate mastery over the area as per the
program's specialization. The knowledge should be at a level higher than the
requirements in the appropriate bachelor's program.
PO4: To develop problem-solving ability to design solutions for complex
engineering problems in the context of societal and environmental commitments.
POS: To demonstrate the capability of functioning effectively as a member or team
leader in software projects considering multidisciplinary environments, thus
solving real-world multifaceted problems.
PO6: To develop design thinking capabilities for innovation and contribute to
technological knowledge and intellectual property development.

Need for the program

 

The past two decades has witnessed the involvement of IT enabled services in every
sector. With the proliferation of social media services, the dynamics of the World
Wide Web has shifted from data consumption to a data generation environment.
The social media services have enabled not only organizations but also individual
users as the content providers. The Internet traffic is increasing exponentially and
so is the volume of data. Applications such as social media, healthcare, e-
commerce, weather forecast, traffic monitoring, etc., are producing massive
amounts of data, the so-called “BIG DATA”, at an unprecedented scale. This has
led to a critical need for skilled professionals, popularly known as Data Scientists,
who can mine and interpret the data. Mining this massive data is an exceedingly
difficult challenge for scientific, technological, and industrial disciplines. In oreder
to fill the gap between the demand and supply of Data Scientists and
Technologiests, the Department of CSE at NIT Agartala offers a two years full time
Masters Programme in Data Science & Engineering.

Scholarship

Students admitted through CCMT are eligible to get a monthly scholarship subject
to fulfilment of other criteria and financial availability from Ministry of Education,
Government of India.

Program duration

Two years (Four Semester) full time.

Program Structure

 

The program has a total of 80 credits. The credits are distributed into 25 credits
each in the Ist and 2nd semester, 10 credits in the 3rd semester, 20 credits in
the 4th semester. The first year (lst and 2nd semester), covers theory and
practical classes, and the 2nd year (3rd and 4th semester), covers a research
Project and thesis. The research can be carried out either in the institute or in an
Industrial organization so that at least one research paper could be published by
the students. The detailed credit, subject and syllabus of the program are available
in the department’s website.

Evaluation System ® (

cience & Engineering

@® Continuous Evaluation system is followed.

&
® Credit based Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) System along with SGPA
(Semester Grade Point Average) system is adopted.

@ Theory subjects are evaluated based on Internal Assessment (30 marks ), Mid
Term Examination(20 marks ), and End Term Examination (50 marks ).
Questions are prepared following the Blooms Taxonomy satisfying the NBA
pattern.

@ Project and Thesis are being evaluated by an Evaluation Committee where
External Expert from renowned institutions/organizations like IITs, NITs are
present to evaluate the works being carried out by the scholar under the
supervision of a faculty member.

Lab Facilities

The institute has a dedicated Data Analytics Lab for the specialization

Training & Placement Facilities

 

The institute has a dedicated training and Placement cell named Career
Counselling Department (CCD) through which students are provided
training, internships and placements.
