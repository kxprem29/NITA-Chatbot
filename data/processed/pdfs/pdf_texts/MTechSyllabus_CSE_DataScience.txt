Objectives of the Data Science & Engineering (DSE) Specialization
The past two decades has witnessed the involvement of IT enabled services in every sector. With the
proliferation of social media services, the dynamics of the World Wide Web has shifted from data
consumption to a data generation environment. The social media services have enabled not only
organizations but also individual users as the content providers. The Internet traffic is increasing
exponentially and so is the volume of data. Applications such as social media, healthcare, e-commerce,
weather forecast, traffic monitoring, etc., are producing massive amounts of data, the so-called “BIG
DATA”, at an unprecedented scale. This has led to a critical need for skilled professionals, popularly
known as Data Scientists, who can mine and interpret the data. Making sense of this massive data is an
exceedingly difficult challenge for scientific, technological, and industrial disciplines. Unfortunately,
there is a gap between the demand and supply of data scientists and technologists due to the following
reasons:
• Due to the generic nature of Undergraduate courses, they fail to address the issues in this area
in a focused manner.
• There are not many postgraduate courses that focus explicitly on Data Science.
Keeping these factors in mind, the Department of CSE at NIT Agartala, proposes a two-year Masters in
Technology (M.Tech.) program in Data Science and Engineering.
Major aspects of the programme,
1) Theoretical foundations: This will include the mathematical background required for the
subjects.
2) Application of Theory: This will include courses where the fundamentals and advanced concepts
(subjects) could be implemented.
3) Thesis/Project Work: Covering the application of the concepts learned or research, oriented work.
The programme can:
1. Build mathematical foundations for studying DSE. (Core subjects)
2. Once the foundations are built, it can give options to the students to choose their domain of
interest (Computer Vision, Speech, Text etc.) so that they can apply the concepts learned. (Elective
subjects).
Career opportunities:
This program would provide students an opportunity to learn both foundational and experimental
components of DSE with application of Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. A student, on
completion of this program, will be able to undertake industry careers involving innovation and
problem-solving and join the industry as a Data Scientist/Data Analyst/Data Engineer. Along with
courses that provide specialization in DSE, students will also have option to explore some applied
domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and software analysis.
