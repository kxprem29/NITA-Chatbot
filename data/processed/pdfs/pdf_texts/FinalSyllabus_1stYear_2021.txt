ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS-I
(UMA11B11)
Total Credit: 03 Contact Periods: 03
(2L+1T+0P)
Purpose of the inclusion of the subject:
Engineering Mathematics is a branch of applied Mathematics concerning mathematical methods
and techniques that are typically used in engineering and industry. Engineering Mathematics is
an interdisciplinary subject motivated by engineers' needs both for practical, theoretical and other
considerations out with their specialization, and to deal with constraints to be effective in their
work.
Historically, Engineering Mathematics consisted mostly of applied analysis, most
notably: differential equations; real and complex analysis (including vector and tensor
analysis); approximation theory (broadly construed, to include asymptotic, variational
and perturbative methods, representations, numerical analysis); Fourier analysis; potential
theory; as well as linear algebra and applied probability, outside of analysis. These areas of
Mathematics were intimately tied to the development of Newtonian physics, and the mathematical
physics of that period. This history also left a legacy: until the early 20th century subjects such
as classical mechanics were often taught in applied mathematics departments at American
universities, and fluid mechanics may still be taught in (applied) mathematics as well as
engineering departments.
The success of modern numerical computer methods and software has led to the emergence
of computational mathematics, computational science, and computational engineering , which
occasionally use high-performance computing for the simulation of phenomena and the solution
of problems in the sciences and engineering. These are often considered interdisciplinary fields,
but are also of interest to Engineering Mathematics.
Why we are teaching that subject in line of PO/PEOs?

(UMA12B13)
Total Credit: 03 Contact Periods: 03 (2L+1T+0P)
Purpose of the inclusion of the subject:
Engineering Mathematics is a key area in the study of an engineering course. It is the study of
numbers, structures, and associated relationships using rigorously defined literal, numerical and
operational symbols. A sound knowledge of the subject develops analytical skills, thus enabling
engineering graduates to solve numerical problems encountered in daily life, as well as apply
mathematical principles to physical problems, particularly in the area of engineering.
Engineering Mathematics is the application of mathematics and computing of problems of modern
engineering. Real world problems of direct engineering, scientific or industrial relevance are
studied using mathematics. Research interests cover mathematics for tomorrow’s technology,
ranging from artificial intelligence (including fuzzy logic, computational intelligence, etc.) to
applied mathematics.
Engineering Mathematics offers a balance of theory and practice, which is both intellectually
stimulating and topical. Learning the craft of applying mathematics to real world problems will
not only equip an engineering student with technical skills, but it will also enhance his/her ability
to make sound judgements on the increasing important role played by science and technology in
the modern world. Industry is well aware of acute skills shortage in various fields including applied
mathematics and computing. These shortages are bound to persist in the near future, due to
increasing demand from employers in line with the industrial growth.
