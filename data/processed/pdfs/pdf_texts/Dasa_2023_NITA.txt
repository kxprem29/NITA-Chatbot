ABOUT DASA
India has long been regarded as an international center of learning. Universities and Institutes of higher education and research
have played an important role in bringing about social change in India. India is ahead of other countries in terms of providing
affordable higher education to its citizens as well as students and scholars from all over the world, regardless of ethnicity or
citizenship.StudentsbecomeapartofadynamicecosystemasaresultofthediverseIndianculture,richtraditions,andinnovative
learning experiences. The right combination of skills, values, and aptitude prepares them to face real-world challenges. The
Technical Institutions that are part of DASA have been recognized as the best in the country. Because of their effective research
and teaching practices, the institutions have been able to establish a name for themselves while also providing students with
ground-breaking career opportunities. All of the institutions involved are self-contained. Furthermore, an Act of Parliament
designated the NITs and IIITs as Institutes of National Importance, and the other institutions as Deemed Universities. A degree
from one of these prestigious institutions not only provides students with excellent career opportunities in architecture,
engineering, and technology, but also helps them achieve significant merit and recognition. These institutions&#39; alumni have
