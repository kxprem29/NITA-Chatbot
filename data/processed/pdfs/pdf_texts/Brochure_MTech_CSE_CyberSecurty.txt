Cyber security is a very fast moving field. A program in
security that aims to be on the forefront has to necessarily
have a companion-advanced program that has a good balance
between theoretical and practical aspects, analytical methods
and system architectures, academic ideas and industry
practices. The MTech in Cybersecurity programme is
designed to provide an outcome-driven and skill-based
learning to make students become proficient cybersecurity
professionals.
