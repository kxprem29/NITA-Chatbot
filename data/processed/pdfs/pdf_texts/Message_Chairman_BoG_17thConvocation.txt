Message from the Chairman, Board of Governors, NIT Agartala

This occasion is a very important milestone in your life.

What are the things which you would want in the journey ahead. We can sum it up in two
words

HAPPINESS
GROWTH

My little experience says that you work to your clarity. You should very seriously and
deeply examine what would happiness and growth mean to you and what you should do
to be happy and grow in life.

This is the most important aspect to your future and | would argue you to work on bringing
this clarity and than work on this so that say after 60 years when you look back at yourself
you can say | have been very happy and | have grown and contributed in what | have
done.

The future is what you will make of it, we may be born with our ‘karma” but my
understanding is you also create your “ karma “ through your thought values and actions
which are totally in your hand and so it is crucial we understand ourselves and act in our
self interest.

Congratulations Class of 2024. May your journey ahead be filled with discovery, purpose
and transformative achievements.

Wishing you all the very best.
