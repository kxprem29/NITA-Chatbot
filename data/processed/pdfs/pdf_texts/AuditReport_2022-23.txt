construction Board (THCB - { 0.76 crore), which are lying unadjusted for more than l0
years. The details regarding advance made to BSNL was not made available to audit. It was
also seen that a total advance amount of { 10'71 crore was made to THCB between April
2008 and November 2010 for construction of Academic Block, Library Media Centre and
construction of 2"d floor at New Computer Science Building. However, the Institute is yet to
receive Utilization certificate amounting to { 0.76 crore till date. No colrespondence was
found on record on this matter after August 2019' Since these are very old advances and

During the financial year 2022-23, the Institute received < 11783 lakh under different heads
as mentioned above as Granfin-Aid from the Govemment of India. Against a total available
fund of t 11627.47 lakh, the Institute could utilize only { 11183.27 takh. An amount of
{

Savings Bank account of the Institute (SBI, NITA Branch A/c No. - XXXX9684) which is
contrary to the idea offiscal discipline.

March 2023 was taken up by this office under section 19(2) of the comptroller and Auditor
General,s (Duties, Powers, and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971. A Separate Audit Report

preparation of annual accounts.
Yours faithfully,

ANNEXURE TO THE MANAGEMENT LETTER
t
1. The Institute during its formation in 2006 has taken over net assets worth 16.08
crore from erstr,l'hile Tripura Engineering College. However, the Institute is yet to
incorporate these assets and tiabilities into its accounts even though it is in possession
of the same.
2. (D A balance of 14.49 lakh held with Canara Bank (Non-Plan Account No. -
XXXX0876) is being carried in the books of the Institute for more than 10 years. The
Institute has also been losing interest on the amount as it is kept in a non-interest-
bearing account.
(ii) The Institute has another account under NIT Transit House Fund with State Bank
of India (A"/c No. - xxxx6l95) which has also become inoperative as a result of no
transactions being carried out.
As such, the need for carrying on with the dormant/ inoperative accounts may be
reviewed by the Management.
3. (i) An amount of { 43.10 crore was not shown under the head "Addition during the
year" and was wrongly showed as "Income from Investments made of the Funds"
under Corpus Fund.
(ii) An amount of { 16.76 crore was wrongly shown as "lncome from Investments
made of the Funds,, instead of showing under the head "Addition during the year"
under Retirement Benefit Fund.
(iii) An amount of { 6.83 lakh was wrongly shown as "lncome from Investments
made of the Funds" instead of showing t 6.25 lakh under the head "Addition during
the year" and t 0.58 lakh "Interest on Savings account" under Infrastructure
Development Fund.
4. Payment of GPF contribution amount of t 0.17 crore made to Sri Niranjan Ghosh
(March 2023), was neither shown as "Addition during the year" nor as "Revenue
Expenditure" under Retirement Benefit Fund.
5. Expenditure amounting to { 0.06 crore pertaining to the year 2021-22 was wrongly
booked under ..Administrative and General expenses" (Schedule - 17) rather than
under "Prior period expenses" (Schedule - 22).
6. The income of Educational lnstitutions is exempt from Income Tax under the
provisions of Section t0 (23 c) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. During 2022-23, the
bankers of the National Institute ofTechnotogy, Agartala (NITA) had deducted a sum
aggregating to 167.62 lakh on account of "Tax Deducted at Source (TDS)" on the
inrerest income eamed by NITA on the Fixed Deposits (FD) maintained with the said
banks (i.e. state Bank of India and Tripura Gramin Bank). Furthermore, other
{
agencies had deducted a sum aggregating to 0.86 takh as TDS on the payments
made to NITA. NITA secured an Income Exemption certificate from the Income Tax
Departmenr under the provisions of 10 (23c) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for the
FYs 2021-22 to 2023-24. However, despite having the exemption certificate, it did not
ensure the effective implementation of the same.

--- Page 10 ---
7. As per Format ol the Ministry, where an Institute has a separate Corpus Fund as an
Earmarked Fund, the heading in the Balance Sheet and in the Schedule concemed
should be changed as "Capital Fund" to avoid confusion. The Institute, however,
retained the heading on the face of Balance Sheet as "Corpus/ Capital Fund" despite
having a separate "Corpus Fund" under Designated/ Earmarked Fund (Schedule 2).
8. In Schedule - 4 (Fixed Assets), the second column under the head "Depreciation"
mentions "On additions during the year" which is incorrect as the column provides
details of depreciation provided during the year. The column head should read
"Depreciation for the year" as per the approved Format.
9. As per the approved Format, Fixed Assets created out of Plan funds and Non-plan
funds are to be exhibited distinctly. The additions during the year from Plan, Non-plan
and other funds and the depreciation on those additions respectively are to be
exhibited distinctty in Sub-schedules A, B, C and D to the main schedule of Fixed
Assets (Schedule-4). However, the same was not followed properly by the Institute.
The words "Non-plan Fund" is mentioned under the head "lntangible Assets", but no
such segmentation is provided under the head "Tangible Assets". Further the Sub-
schedules as mentioned before have also not been provided in the Accounts.
10. In terms of instructions and accounting principles, the amount of caution money
refundable to students during 12 months from the balance sheet date should be shown
in the following manner:
o
From current students
r
From ex-students
But it was noticed from the Schedule-3 of the Annual Accounts that caution money
was shown under two separate heads, viz. "Deposits from students" (u'hich represents
Library caution money) and "Hostel caution money" instead of showing bifurcation of
caution money refundable to students in the aforesaid manner, thus being in
contravention to the prescribed format.
ll. The Institute has shown an amount of t 1.93 crore as "All other Fees" under
Academic Collection which should be bifurcated, as per the MHRD format
requirement.
12. (i) The Transit House Fund (SBI A./c No. - XXXX6195) held with Kunjavan Branch
has been wrongly shown in the accounts under the Current Assets (Schedule - 7) as
held with N/77 Branch.
(ii) The Non-Plan Fund (Canara Bank A/c No. - XXXX0876) is a Current Account
but has been wrongly categorized as Savings Accounts under the Current Assets
(Schedule - 7).
Balance Sheet - Application of Funds - Investment from Earmarked /
t
Endowment Funds (Schedule - 5) - 168.01 crore
13. The above includes "Mutual Fund with SBI, NITA Branch - NITA Corpus Fund"
amounting to {5 crore. Scrutiny of records revealed that an amount of { 5 crore was
invested in SBI Savings Fund during November 2020. However, the amount was
initially switched out on 22 March 2021 to SBI Banking & PSU Fund and again on

--- Page 11 ---
12 J,nary 2023 ro SBI Magnum Income Fund. As switch-outs from a particular
Mutual Fund (MF) scheme are treated as redemption and switch-ins are tieated as
new investments, the face value (investment amount) changes each time switch-outs
are done from any scheme. As such, the investment amount (cost price) of the
Mutual Fund as on 31 March 2023 stands at { 5.39 crore while the income ieceived
from the investment (capital gain) is { 0.39 crore. The value of the MF as on
3l March 2023 stands at { 5.45 crore thereby having an accrued income of { 0.06
crore. The Institute has accounted for an accrued income of { 0.25 crore on the MF
on an arbitrary basis. Hence, "Mutual Fund with SBI, NITA Branch - NITA Corpus
Fund" is understated by t 0.39 crore, "Interest received on Investments', is
understated by { 0.39 crore while "Accrued Interest on Investment,,is overstated bv
{ 0. l9 crore.
Application of Funds- Investment from Earmarked/ Endowment Funds
(Schedule - 5) - { 168.01 crore - Fixed Deposits with scheduled banks - t 16.0f
crore
14. The above is overstated by t 5.36 lakh due to wrong accounting of face value ofone
Fixed Deposit (FD) held with State Bank of India, NITA Branch under ..Retiremenr
Benefit Fund" (FD No. 30359168928). The face value ofthe FD as on 3l March 2023
t
stands at 28.98 lakh while the Institute entered the face value as { 34.34 lakh, which
is the value ofthe FD as on 02 April2023 (FY 2023-24) on renewal. The Institute has
accounted the entire interest of { 3.91 lakh as "Interest received" (Interest received
{ 5.36 lakh minus opening accrued interest of one year { L45 lakh) while an
(
additional "Accrued interest" of 1.72 lakh has also been accounted for. However,
the lnstitute should have accounted for an "Accrued Interest" of { 1.79 lakh for the
FY 2022-23 while there was no interest received as the FD did not mature during the
year. As such, the "Fixed Deposits with scheduled banks" is overstated by { 5.36
lakh, "Interest received on FD" is overstated by { 3.91 lakh (after adjusting for
opening accrued interest of { 1.45 lakh) while "Accrued interest on FD" is
t
understated by 0.07 lakh.
Sources of Funds- Current Liabilities and Provision (Schedule -3) - t. 13.54
crore
15. The above is understated by 117.62 lakh due to non-provision of expenditures
pertaining to the financial year 2022-23 which were paid during 2023-24. This also
resulted in overstatement of"Excess of Income over Expenditure" for the current year
by the same amount.
