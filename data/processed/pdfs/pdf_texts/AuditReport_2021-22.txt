2. This Separate Audit Report contains the comments of the Compiroller and Auditor
General (C&AG) of India on the accounting treatment only with regard to classification,

etc, Audit observations on financial transactions with regard to compliance with the Law,

ete., if any, are reported through Inspection Reports/C&AG’s Audit Reports separately.

3. We have conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards generally
accepted in India. These standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material
misstatements. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosure in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the

evaluating the overall presentation of financial statements. We believe that our audit

4, Based on our audit, we report that:

i) We have obtained all the information and explanations, which to the best of our
knowledge and belief were necessary for the purpose of cur audit.

iv) We further report that:

A. Income & Expenditure Account

Excess of Income over Expenditure: t 15.86 crore

Expenditure: = 121.45 crore

Contribution to Retirement Benefit Fund: ¥ 11.57 crore

A.}  Short-provisioning in respect of Employee’s Retirement and Terminal Benefit
Payment Obligations as per the Actuarial Valuation Report aggregating to = 8.07 crore
has resulted in the overstatement of the ‘Excess of Income over the Expenditure’ for the
FY 2021-22 by a sum of ¥ 8.07 crore with the corresponding understatement of the
“Current Liabilities & Provisions by the same extent.

Excess of Income over Expenditure: T 15.86 crore

Interest Earned: 64.32 jakh [Schedule 12]

1) On Savings Accounts;

a} With Scheduled Banks: 47.54 lakh

A.2 As per the provisions of Rule 230(8} of GFRs 2037, the Ministry of Education,
Government of India (MoE, Gol) in its all of its sanction letters has also mentioned that all
interests earned against Grants-in-Aids (Other than reimbursement) released to the
University/educational institutes shall be mandatorily remitted to the parent Ministry
Account inimediately after finalization of accounts. Any interest earned out of Grants-in-
Aid shall not be treated as additional funds over and above allocation.

However, NITA Management, in contravention of the aforementioned instructions issued
by the Ministry of Finance, has exhibited the said interest-income as its own income under
the account head “Interest Earned [Schedule 12]” instead of showing the same under the
account head “Current Liabilities and Provisions”.

As such, inaccurate accounting of the interest-income earned on the MoE, Gol’s Fund has
resulted in to the overstatement of ‘Intcrest Earned’ by a sum of % 47.54 lakh with the
corresponding overstatement of the ‘Excess of Income over Expenditure’ as well as
understatement ‘Current Liabilities and Provisions’ for the FY 2021-22 by the same exient.

Prior Period Income: ¥ 55.44 Lakh [Schedule [4]

NITA though the underlying issue was pointed out by the Comptroller & Auditor General
of India in the previous FYs as well. However, the NITA Management has failed to make
the necessary amends til] date,

B. General

B.1 Format of Accounts

Significant accounting policies, SI.No.1, para 3 states that the National Institute of
Technology, Agartala(NITA) has prepared the Annual Accounts for the financial year (FY)
2021-22 as per the format provided by the Ministry of Education {formerly, Ministry of


--- Page 5 ---
Human Resources Development, Government of India (MHRD}} with the approval of the
Comptroller and Auditor General of India. However, the following instances were noticed
wherein the requirement of the prescribed format was not adhered to:

 

SI. Name of

No Schedule Nature of non-compliance

 

 

l. Schedule 9 | As per the format requirements, any items under the head
Academic | Miscellaneous income which exceeds 1 per cent of the total
Receipts turnover/grass income of entity or € 50, 000/- whichever is higher

shall be shown as a separate and distinct item against an appropriate
account head in the income and Expenditure Account.

NITA has exhibited an amount of * 1,95,06,600 as ‘All other Fees’
under the head ‘Academic Collection’ which should be bifurcated as
per the Ministry of Education (formerly, MHRD) format requirement.

 

 

 

 

 

Corpus/Capital Fund: F 750.99 crore
Income & Expenditure for the Y/E 31.03.2022

Excess of Income over Expenditure: € £5.86 crore
Academic Receipts : % 27.64 crore [Schedule 9]
Expenditure : % 121.46 crore
Contribution to Corpus Fund =; = 20 crore

B.2 ~~ NITA, had transferred a sum of % 20 crore to Corpus Fund A/c, has claimed a
deduction of f 20 crore as an ‘expenditure’ in its Income & Expenditure Account for the
Y/E 31 March 2022. Further, NITA has been doing so in respect of its previous FYs as
well since FY 2009-10,

However, the purpose and treatment of such transfer to Corpus Fund A/c could not be
ascertained from the books of accounts and this should be properly disclosed in the books
of accounts for better understanding.

Income and Expenditure Account
Excess of Income over Expenditure: % 15.86 crore
Grants & Subsidies: € 107.67 crore [Schedule 16]

B.3 As per Schedule 10, it was observed that the Institute had transferred the capital
expenditure incurred amounting to % 24.62 crore to Income and Expenditure account
instead of Capital/Corpus fund. The above treatment is not as per the approved format.
Hence the Institute is required to do the treatment of Grant-in-Aid as prescribed in the
approved format.

Further, as per MHRD guidelines, excess expenditure incurred over and above the

Grant-in-Aid may be met from internal resources and may not be shown as receivable.
However, the Institute had shown negattve closing balance of Grant-in-Ard. This treatment

is not as per the above Guidelines.

 


--- Page 6 ---
Excess of Income over Expenditure: € 15.86 crore
Prior Period Income: & 55.44 Lakh [Schedule 14]

B.4— The Institute had not accounted for Hostel Fees as well as Mess fees collected by
NITA though the underlying issue was pointed out by the Comptroller & Auditor General
of India in the previous FYs as well. However, the NITA Management has failed to make
the necessary amends till date.

B35 National Institute of Technology, Agartala (NITA) during its formation in the year
2006 had taken over the net assets of 16.08 crore from the erstwhile Tripura Engineering
College (TEC). However, NITA, till date, has failed to incorporate the taken-over assets
and liabilities of TEC into its accounts on ‘Put-to-Basis’ notwithstanding the possession of
and use of the same. Until confirmation from DHE, GOI, they should give proper disclosure
in their accounts for better understanding of the accounts..

B.6 The Electro-mechanical work in the swimming pool component of the Sports
Complex at the National Institute of Technology, Agartala (NITA), had not been taken up
as on 31.03.2022. In the 43" Building and Works Committee Meeting dated 21.06.2019, it
was decided to invite the Expression of Interest (EOD for the balance work at an estimated
cost of € 4.47 crore. Accordingly, the asset value of swimming pool (aquatic center)
included in the capitalised value of ¥ 64.40 crore under Sport Complex in the accounts of
the NITA for the FY 2020-21 should be reversed to Capital Work-in-Progress (CWIP)
uatil the swimming pool is ready for use.

The component-cost of the swimming pool that had been earlier capitalised by the NITA
Management couldn’t be quantified because of non-production of the
details/records/information on account of the related files being in possession with the
Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).

B.7 The Institute had not made any provision im respect of the advances made to Bharat
Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) and Tripura Housing and Construction Board (THCB)
and the same lying unadjusted since several years with no details in respect of the same
being available with the Management

B.8 The Institute had not accounted for a Fixed Deposit(FD) (Certificate No. 630074)
maintained with the Tripura Gramin Bank .

B.9 ~~ The Institute had not charged Depreciation on assets for the prior periods and
Institute is required to ascertain it and account for in Books of Accounts.

B.10 The Institute had depicted the interest accrued income of € 27.52 lakh on the said
Mutual Fund as < 25 lakh under the account ‘Interest on Fixed Deposits- General A/c’ is
improper and the same should be exhibited as ‘Income accrued on Investments- Others: %
25 lakh’ under the Loans, Advance & Deposits.

The Institute had also done inaccurate accountal of payments aggregating to f 13.45 Lakh
in respect of bills pertaining to the FY 2021-22 which were made in the
FY 2022-23 i.e. in the months of April 2022 to July 2022. However, ihe same were not

 


--- Page 7 ---
duly accounted for as ‘Expenses’ in the FY 2021-22 thereby violating the accrual basis
concept of accounting.

C. Grant-in-aid

Treasure Single Account System (TSA), being an essential tool, for consolidating and
managing Governments’ cash resources, thereby minimizing borrowing costs of the
Government was rolled out by the MoE, Gol in the National Institute of Technologies
(NITs) in February 2021. For the Central Autonomous Bodies (CABs), a centralized TSA
model is followed where the accounts of the agencies are opened in the Reserve Bank of
India (RBI) itself. This account is then allotted an assignment limit by the parent Ministry.
AL expenditures incurred by CABs are, subsequently, debited directly to the Government
account in RBI instead of funds being transferred upfront by the parent Ministry to a
commercial bank account of the CAB. Further, any unspent amounts in the aforementioned
RBI Account at the year-end is automatically reduced to zero thereby implying that the
unspent balances of Grant-in-Aids, if any, has to be surrendered to the Government at the
year-end to enforce fiscal discipline.

The details of Grant-in-Aid received by the NITA during the FY2021-22 as well as the
utilisation in respect thereof is summarised as under:

(Amount :¥ in crore)

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Head Opening Received Extent of Reversed | Closing

(i.e. for Capital (88.85%)
Expenditure purposes)
Total 9.15 98.51 106.09 5.83

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

During the FY 2021-22, NITA was in receipt of a total corpus of ¥ 98.51 crore under the
Salary Head (% 51.88 crore), Recurring Head (® 38.53 crore) and CAPEX head (% 8.10
crore) as Grant-in-Aid from the Ministry of Education, Government of India (MoE, Gol).
As on 01.04.2021, an unspent balance of € 20.54 crore under the recurring head as well as
CAPEX head was lying with NITA. Further, opening negative unspent balance of 11.39
crore was lying with NITA as on 01.04.2021.

As against the total available Grants aggregating to = 79.96 crore under the Salary Head
and the Recurring Head during the FY 2021-22, NITA spent a total sum of % 83.05 crore
under the Salary Head (% 44.89 crore) and the Recurring Head (% 38.16 crore). Further, an

 


--- Page 8 ---
unspent balance of Grant-in-Aid aggregating to % 1.56 crore was reversed through the
Public Financial Management System (PFMS) to the MoE, Gol on 31 March 2022.

NITA was in receipt of € 8.10 crore under the head Capital Assets during the FY 2021-22.
Further, as against the total available fund of ¥ 27.71 crore inclusive of the opening balance
of % 19.61 crore under the head Capital Assets, NITA expended a sum of & 24.62 crore
under the head Capital Assets during the FY 2021-22.

It was observed that NITA, as envisaged under the TSA system, failed to refund to the
unspent balances of Grant-in-Aids aggregating to T 20.54 crore under the Recurring and
CAPEX head as on 31.03.2021 and utilised the same to the extent of = 17.48 crore during
the FY 2021-22. NITA again failed to surrender the unutilised opening balances of the FY
2021-22 pertaining to the CAPEX Grant-in-Aid aggregating to = 3.10 crore at the year-end
on 31 March 2022. The said amount of = 3.10 crore couldn’t be reversed through PFMS
since it pertained to the fund received by the NITA from the MoE, Gol prior to the
implementation of TSA in NITA in July 2021.

Failure to surrender the unspent Grant-in-Aid balances on the part of NITA was not in-line
with the objective of ensuring fiscal discipline envisaged under the TSA.

Further, as per MHRD Guidelines, excess expenditure incurred over and above the Grant-
in-Aid may be met from internal resources and may not be shown as receivable. However,
the Institute had shown negative closing balance of Grant in aid. This treatment is not as
per the above Guidelines.

vi) In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations
given to us, the said financial statements read with the Accounting Policies and Notes on
Accounts, and subject to the Significant matters stated above and other matters mentioned
in Annexure to this Audit Report, give a true and fair view in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in India:

2) Inso far it relates to the Balance Sheet of the state of affairs of the National Institute
of Technology, Agartala as on 31.03.2022,

b) In so far as it relates to Income and Expenditure Account of the profit for the year
ended on that date.

Annexure to Management Letter

National Institute of Technology, Agartala, Tripura (NITA) is having a current
account with Canara Bank (A/c no-2348201000876) with balance of Rs.
4,48,955 as on 31.03.2022. The said bank account is exhibiting the same
balance since the previous six financial years (FYs).The need to keep the
dormant account may please be assessed.

As per Ministry of Human Resources Department, Government of India
(MHRD) issued format of accounts- instructions for Stock accounting (page
50), the value of closing stocks held on 31“ March is set up as inventories by
reducing corresponding revenue expenditure on the purchase of chemicals,
glassware, publications and other stores on the basis of information obtained
from respective Departments and valued at cost.

As per Si. No.4 on Inventory valuation (Schedule-23-Significant Accounting
Policies) of accounts of NITA, expenditure on inventory is booked on cash
basis and no closing stock for the same is shown in Balance Sheet. However,
Department-wise Stock Register is maintained by NITA. The accounting
policy for inventory valuation may be suitably changed and closing stock of
inventory as on 31% March may be valued, as illustrated, in the MHRD format
of accounts.

NITA has six number of hostels for students. 11 numbers of Bank accounts
(five in SBI, five in Canara Bank and one in PNB) exist for Hostel purpose
with bank balance of € 10.30 crore as on 31.03.2022. Scrutiny of the records
revealed that since the year 2019, NITA is using a single Bank account (NITA
Hostel Fund A/c -4121132000005-Canara Bank) for hostel operation purpose.
All the 11 numbers of bank accounts with bank balance of F 10.30 crore as on
31.03.2022 are lying dormant for since three FYs. In December 2018 it was
decided by NITA Management to close the dormant bank accounts but the
same has not been implemented till date. The hostel bank balance of € 10.30
crore as on 31.03.2022 has not been exhibited in the accounts of the NITA for
the FY 2021-22.

Prevalent Financial Management as well as Internal Control & Internal Audit
System in NITA needs to be strengthened. Instances of poor management of
financial resources were noticed as a consequence of which NITA suffered
loss of interest-incomes incomes aggregating to ¥ 1.52 crore.
