the subject(s) in which he/ she will be found adopting unfair means in
the examination.
Item No. S/1 4lll Consideration and approval of selection of students for admission
in BS-MS programme in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics
through Institute test.
In regard to the admission of candidates in BS-MS programme in
Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics by conducting an Institute test the
SENATE decided that status-quo would be maintained for the present.
The existing system of admission in BS-MS programme through
CSAB will continue as usual.
Item No. S/1 4ll2 Consideration and approval of allowing admission of the students
in Ph.D in Engineering in the Department of Physics.
The SENATE declined to approve the proposal of allowing admission
of the students in Ph.D in Engineering in the Department of Physics.
However, the SENATE gave the following suggestion:
.
The Dean (AA) would constitute a committee consisting of
3(three) members such as Dean (R&C), Dean (FW) and Dr.
{oy Chakraborty, Asso. Professor & HOD Electrical
Engineering which would consider the matter appropriately
and give necessary suggestion to the SENATE for arriving at a
suitable decision.
o
The Head of the Department of Physics would collect relevant
information in this regard from other IITs and NITs and place
the same before the Dean(AA).
