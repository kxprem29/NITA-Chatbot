A CRF is of utmost importance in any academic institution where state-of-the-art analytical and high-end instruments are housed at a single location manned by qualified personnel to provide scientific and technical services for supporting research, carried out by UG, PG, PhD and project students. Such a facility represents a key commitment for preserving and raising the efficiency of research to top international standards. It strengthens the research-relevant infrastructure of Science and Technology.\n\nAt NIT Agartala, to begin with, CRF has been developed with various sophisticated equipment and instruments, mainly:\n\nX-ray Diffractometer (XRD)\n\nScanning Electron Microscope (SEM)\n\nTransmission Electron Microscope (TEM)\n\nLiquid Nitrogen Plant (LNP)\n\nAtomic Force Microscope (AFM)\n\nAll equipment and instruments under CRF will be used for various types of characterization including study of structure and chemical composition of surfaces and bulk materials at different length scales (sub-nanometer to millimeter), phase transitions, as well as evaluation of mechanical, electrical, magnetic, and optical properties. Liquid Nitrogen Plant (LNP) will help to produce Nitrogen in liquid form which can be utilized for developing low temperature research facility in the areas of Bio-Engineering, Chemistry and Medical Science.\n\nObjectives of the CRF:-\n\nOur objective is to extend the present research facilities to fulfill the following objectives:\n\nto carry out analysis of samples received from the scientists/institutes;\n\nto provide facilities of sophisticated analytical instruments to scientists and other users from academic institutes, R&D laboratories and industries to enable them to carry out measurements for R&D work;\n\nto organize short term courses/workshops on the use and application of various instruments and analytical techniques;\n\nto train technicians for maintenance and operation of sophisticated instruments; and\n\nto carry out more effective and result oriented research of international level in the field of Science & Technology.\n\nUsers of the Facilities: -\n\nAll researchers from Academic Institutions and Industries.",

In its widest use, student is used for anyone who is learning.\n\nEven being in the remote Norh Eastern part of India, the students of NIT Agartala are not lagging behind in any of the activities.The students take active part in all sorts of activities held in cultural fests, in or outside the campus. The history of the college speaks of the students of NIT Agartala, their achievements in various events relating to science and technology and thier success in competitions being organized in various elite institues from various parts of thee country. The senior students feel their responsibility to help the junior students. It is very much true that the students and the faculty members help an institution to reach their persuing goal. This environment can be found in reality in this college. Needless to say, the effective and high quality feedback has been identified as a key element of quality teaching, and such arguments are well supported by the findings of meta-analysed studies that faculty members have coupled from their experiences and expertises with research on teams to create a number of resources that hopefully will help faculty members increase the effectiveness of students in their courses.",

        "page_content": "Life on Campus\n\nOur Students IThe word student is etymologically derived through Middle English from the Latin second-type conjugation verb studere, meaning \"to direct one's zeal at\"; hence a student could be described as \"one who directs zeal at a subject\". In its widest use, student is used for anyone who is learning. Even being in the remote Norh Eastern part of India, the students of NIT Agartala are not lagging behind in any of the activities.The students take active part in all sorts of activities held in cultural fests, in or outside the campus. The history of the college speaks of the students of NIT Agartala, their achievements in various events relating to science and technology and thier success in competitions being organized in various elite institues from various parts of thee country. The senior students feel their responsibility to help the junior students. It is very much true that the students and the faculty members help an institution to reach their persuing goal. This environment can be found in reality in this college. Needless to say, the effective and high quality feedback has been identified as a key element of quality teaching, and such arguments are well supported by the findings of meta-analysed studies that faculty members have coupled from their experiences and expertises with research on teams to create a number of resources that hopefully will help faculty members increase the effectiveness of students in their courses.",
